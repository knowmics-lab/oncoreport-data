Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors.	,,Lim SM. et al.,Oncotarget,2016

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.

Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors. (Funded by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, and others.).;;Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are highly responsive to treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;The identification of molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a key step to improve therapeutic results for patients with oncogene addiction. Several alterations leading to EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) resistance to TKI therapy have been described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Only two mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain responsible for crizotinib resistance have been described in patients thus far. A patient suffering from a metastatic NSCLC harboring an ezrin (EZR)-ROS1 fusion gene developed acquired resistance to the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. Molecular analysis (whole-exome sequencing, CGH) and functional studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. Based on this case, we took advantage of the structural homology of ROS1 and ALK to build a predictive model for drug sensitivity regarding future ROS1 mutations. Sequencing revealed a dual mutation, S1986Y and S1986F, in the ROS1 kinase domain. Functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ROS1 harboring either the S1986Y or the S1986F mutation, while conferring resistance to crizotinib and ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib (PF-06463922). The patient's clinical response confirmed the potency of lorlatinib against S1986Y/F mutations. The ROS1 S1986Y/F and ALK C1156Y mutations are homologous and displayed similar sensitivity patterns to ALK/ROS1 TKIs. We extended this analogy to build a model predicting TKI efficacy against potential ROS1 mutations. Clinical evidence, in vitro validation, and homology-based prediction provide guidance for treatment decision making for patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who progressed on crizotinib.

Establishment of such biomarkers will help identify a subset of patients that will benefit from cetuximab therapy. In this paper, we report on a patient with HNSCC who had a complete tumour regression following treatment with cetuximab given as a single agent after initial surgery and radiation therapy. The EGFR protein expression level, the EGFR gene copy number and the EGFR gene sequence were assessed from both normal and tumour tissues. Besides protein overexpression and gene amplification in the tumour tissue, sequencing of the EGFR gene from the patient revealed the presence of two somatic mutations, one in the kinase domain (R705G) and the other in the ligand binding domain (P546S). Cells that stably express these EGFR mutants were treated with cetuximab and their sensitivity to the drug was compared to cells expressing the wildtype gene. While P546S mutation sensitised NIH-3T3 cells to cetuximab, R705G had a marginal effect. The double mutant (P546S/R705G) behaved like the P546S mutant, indicating that the mutation in the kinase domain does not contribute to the increased sensitivity to cetuximab. No mutations were found in K-RAS or B-RAF genes and no HPV protein or DNA was detected in the tumour. This is the first report of a somatic mutation in the EGFR ligand binding domain that may contribute to increased sensitivity to cetuximab. Our results support a role for the P546S mutation in cetuximab sensitivity. Other factors including EGFR protein high copy number and protein overexpression may have also contributed to the observed response. The severity of a skin rash developed by this patient and its correlation with the antitumour activity does not exclude the involvement of the immune system (i.e. complement-mediated immune response) as well. The occurrence of the P546S mutation needs to be evaluated in HNSCC, as a well as a prospective evaluation of cetuximab anti-tumour activity in patients with tumours harbouring the mutation.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

The identification of additional oncogenic and drug-sensitive alterations may similarly lead to new therapeutic approaches for lung cancer. We identify and characterize novel FGFR2 extracellular domain insertion mutations and demonstrate that they are both oncogenic and sensitive to inhibition by FGFR kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate that the mechanism of FGFR2 activation and subsequent transformation is mediated by ligand-independent dimerization and activation of FGFR2 kinase activity. Both FGFR2-mutant forms are predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi but nevertheless can activate downstream signaling pathways through their interactions with fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2). Our findings provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting this unique subset of FGFR2-mutant cancers as well as insight into their oncogenic mechanisms.;;;;;;;;We sought to identify fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib, and explore the mechanism of action of the drug-resistant mutations. We cultured BaF3 cells overexpressing FGFR2 in high concentrations of dovitinib and identified 14 dovitinib-resistant mutations, including the N550K mutation observed in 25% of FGFR2(mutant) endometrial cancers (ECs). Structural and biochemical in vitro kinase analyses, together with BaF3 proliferation assays, showed that the resistance mutations elevate the intrinsic kinase activity of FGFR2. BaF3 lines were used to assess the ability of each mutation to confer cross-resistance to PD173074 and ponatinib. Unlike PD173074, ponatinib effectively inhibited all the dovitinib-resistant FGFR2 mutants except the V565I gatekeeper mutation, suggesting ponatinib but not dovitinib targets the active conformation of FGFR2 kinase. EC cell lines expressing wild-type FGFR2 were relatively resistant to all inhibitors, whereas EC cell lines expressing mutated FGFR2 showed differential sensitivity. Within the FGFR2(mutant) cell lines, three of seven showed marked resistance to PD173074 and relative resistance to dovitinib and ponatinib. This suggests that alternative mechanisms distinct from kinase domain mutations are responsible for intrinsic resistance in these three EC lines. Finally, overexpression of FGFR2(N550K) in JHUEM-2 cells (FGFR2(C383R)) conferred resistance (about five-fold) to PD173074, providing independent data that FGFR2(N550K) can be associated with drug resistance. Biochemical in vitro kinase analyses also show that ponatinib is more effective than dovitinib at inhibiting FGFR2(N550K). We propose that tumors harboring mutationally activated FGFRs should be treated with FGFR inhibitors that specifically bind the active kinase.;;We sought to identify fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib, and explore the mechanism of action of the drug-resistant mutations.

Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors. This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive). Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t½ was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients. Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.	Tanizaki J. et al.,Cancer Res.,2015;;;;;;;;Byron SA. et al.,Neoplasia,2013;;Byron SA. et al.,Neoplasia,2013;;Soria JC. et al.,Ann. Oncol.,2014

This oncogene that activates the adenylate cyclase is also mutated in various tumor types leading to the accumulation of cyclic-AMP. Identification of a hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in two MCA patients led us to search for GNAS activation in benign and malignant hepatocellular carcinogenesis. GNAS mutations were screened by sequencing 164 HCA, 245 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 17 fibrolamellar carcinomas. Tumors were characterized by quantitative RT-PCR, gene mutation screening and pathological reviewing. The consequences of wild type and mutant GNAS expression were analyzed in hepatocellular cell lines. A somatic GNAS-activating mutation was identified in 5 benign tumors and in 2 HCC. In benign tumors, GNAS mutations were exclusive from HNF1A, CTNNB1, and IL6ST mutations whereas one HCC demonstrated both CTNNB1 and GNAS mutations. Quantitative RT-PCR showed an activation of the IL-6 and interferon pathways in GNAS-mutated tumor tissues. Accordingly, pathological reviewing identified in GNAS-mutated tumors an inflammatory phenotype characterized by fibrosis and STAT3 activation. We further demonstrated in HCC cell lines that GNAS mutant expression induced inflammatory response and STAT3 activation. We identified for the first time the association between two rare diseases, MCA syndrome and HCA occurrence, but also that somatic GNAS-activating mutations in sporadic benign and malignant liver tumors are characterized by an inflammatory phenotype. These results showed a cross-talk between cyclic-AMP and JAK/STAT pathways in liver tumors and they reinforce the role of STAT3 activation in liver tumorigenesis.	Nault JC. et al.,J. Hepatol.,2012

More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. Potent and selective BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefits in patients with V600E and V600K BRAF-mutated melanoma. V600R mutations constitute approximately 3-7% of all BRAF mutations and the activity of BRAF inhibitors in patients with this mutation is unknown. We have treated 45 patients with V600 mutated melanoma including patients with V600R mutation between July 2011 and October 2012 with the selective BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (n=43) or vemurafenib (n=2) via a compassionate access programme. The overall response rate was 50% for the whole population with a progression-free survival of 5.5 months. Five objective responses were seen in six assessable patients with V600R BRAF mutation (n=9). Our experience suggests that patients with V600R BRAF mutations can be treated successfully with oral BRAF inhibitors, and molecular diagnostic assays should include detection of this type of mutation.;;BRAF mutations promote melanoma cell proliferation and survival primarily through activation of MEK. The purpose of this study was to determine the response rate (RR) for the selective, allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma. This was an open-label, two-stage, phase II study with two cohorts. Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily. In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed. Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.,,MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future.

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair. Toxicity in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar to that reported previously in those without such mutations. AstraZeneca.,,Olaparib is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor with activity in germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) -associated breast and ovarian cancers. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib in a spectrum of BRCA1/2-associated cancers. This multicenter phase II study enrolled individuals with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation and recurrent cancer. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy. Olaparib was administered at 400 mg twice per day. The primary efficacy end point was tumor response rate. A total of 298 patients received treatment and were evaluable. The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%). Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.;;Oral administration of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide at low doses, metronomic dosing, is well tolerated, with efficacy in multiple tumor types. PARP inhibition potentiates effects of cyclophosphamide in preclinical models. We conducted a phase I trial of the PARP inhibitor veliparib and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies. Objectives were to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination; characterize veliparib pharmacokinetics (PK); measure poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), a product of PARP, in tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); and measure the DNA-damage marker γH2AX in PBMCs and circulating tumor cells (CTC). Cyclophosphamide was administered once daily in 21-day cycles in combination with veliparib administered once daily for 7, 14, or 21 days. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The study treatment was well tolerated, and the MTD was established as veliparib 60 mg with cyclophosphamide 50 mg given once daily. Seven patients had partial responses; an additional six patients had disease stabilization for at least six cycles. PAR was significantly decreased in PBMCs (by at least 50%) and tumor biopsies (by at least 80%) across dose levels (DL); γH2AX levels were increased in CTCs from seven of nine patients evaluated after drug administration. The combination of veliparib with metronomic cyclophosphamide is well tolerated and shows promising activity in a subset of patients with BRCA mutations. A phase II trial of the combination compared with single-agent cyclophosphamide is ongoing in BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and low-grade lymphoma.,,;;Tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in a complex gene network that regulates homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Disruption of the BRCA-network through gene mutation, deletion, or RNAi-mediated silencing can sensitize cells to small molecule inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi). Here, we demonstrate that BRCA-network disruption in the presence of PARPi leads to the selective induction and enhancement of interferon pathway and apoptotic gene expression in cultured tumor cells. In addition, we report PARPi cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient tumor cells is enhanced >10-fold when combined with interferon-γ. These findings establish a link between synthetic lethality of PARPi in BRCA-network disrupted cells and interferon pathway activation triggered by genetic instability.;;Our objective was to determine the rate of BRCA1/2 deficiency in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumors from a cohort of unselect patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOH). BRCA1/2 mutation analysis was performed in 29 patients with platinum-sensitive EOC and 24 patients with platinum-resistant disease. Germline DNA was analyzed in mutation carriers when normal tissue was available. BRCA expression was ascertained by quantitative rt-PCR. Associations between BRCA mutation status and expression levels and parameters of platinum response were analyzed. Fifteen of 53 (28.3%) EOC tumors had BRCA1/2 mutations. Twelve mutations were in BRCA1, while 3 involved BRCA2. Of the 12 mutation-carriers with normal tissue available for DNA analyses, 33.3% of the mutations were found to be somatic. Three mutations were novel. The majority of BRCA mutations (73%) were identified in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. In total, 38% of platinum-sensitive tumors were found to have a BRCA mutation, compared to 17% of the platinum-resistant patients. A statistical trend toward platinum-sensitive disease was seen in BRCA mutation carriers (p=0.079). Nineteen (36%) study patients had some form of BRCA deficiency, and these patients were less likely to have platinum-resistant tumors (OR=0.29; p value=0.048). BRCA mutations occurred more frequently in platinum-sensitive EOC than platinum-resistant disease. The high overall frequency of BRCA deficiency in EOC underscores the importance of tumor profiling as therapies targeting the DNA repair pathway are being investigated.,,The frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations in women with ovarian cancer is unclear; reports vary from 3% to 27%. The impact of germ-line mutation on response requires further investigation to understand its impact on treatment planning and clinical trial design. Women with nonmucinous ovarian carcinoma (n = 1,001) enrolled onto a population-based, case-control study were screened for point mutations and large deletions in both genes. Survival outcomes and responses to multiple lines of chemotherapy were assessed. Germ-line mutations were found in 14.1% of patients overall, including 16.6% of serous cancer patients (high-gradeserous, 17.1%); [corrected] 44% had no reported family history of breast orovarian cancer.Patients carrying germ-line mutations had improved rates of progression-free and overall survival. In the relapse setting, patients carrying mutations more frequently responded to both platin- and nonplatin-based regimens than mutation-negative patients, even in patients with early relapse after primary treatment. Mutation-negative patients who responded to multiple cycles of platin-based treatment were more likely to carry somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. BRCA mutation status has a major influence on survival in ovarian cancer patients and should be an additional stratification factor in clinical trials. Treatment outcomes in BRCA1/2 carriers challenge conventional definitions of platin resistance, and mutation status may be able to contribute to decision making and systemic therapy selection in the relapse setting. Our data, together with the advent of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor trials, supports the recommendation that germ-line BRCA1/2 testing should be offered to all women diagnosed with nonmucinous, ovarian carcinoma, regardless of family history.;;Olaparib is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor with activity in germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) -associated breast and ovarian cancers. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib in a spectrum of BRCA1/2-associated cancers.

Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy. Olaparib was administered at 400 mg twice per day. The primary efficacy end point was tumor response rate. A total of 298 patients received treatment and were evaluable. The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%). Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.,,Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of malignancies and a major health burden. We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal rearrangements leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known to be important in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and new candidate drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence. Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA damage repair deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals with these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded. ,,The inhibition of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a potential synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers with specific DNA-repair defects, including those arising in carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We conducted a clinical evaluation in humans of olaparib (AZD2281), a novel, potent, orally active PARP inhibitor. This was a phase 1 trial that included the analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of olaparib. Selection was aimed at having a study population enriched in carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We enrolled and treated 60 patients; 22 were carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 1 had a strong family history of BRCA-associated cancer but declined to undergo mutational testing. The olaparib dose and schedule were increased from 10 mg daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 mg twice daily continuously. Reversible dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one of eight patients receiving 400 mg twice daily (grade 3 mood alteration and fatigue) and two of five patients receiving 600 mg twice daily (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 somnolence). This led us to enroll another cohort, consisting only of carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, to receive olaparib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the mutation carriers. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination; pharmacodynamic studies confirmed PARP inhibition in surrogate samples (of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and plucked eyebrow-hair follicles) and tumor tissue. Objective antitumor activity was reported only in mutation carriers, all of whom had ovarian, breast, or prostate cancer and had received multiple treatment regimens. Olaparib has few of the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapy, inhibits PARP, and has antitumor activity in cancer associated with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00516373.),,Olaparib is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor with activity in germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) -associated breast and ovarian cancers. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of olaparib in a spectrum of BRCA1/2-associated cancers. This multicenter phase II study enrolled individuals with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation and recurrent cancer. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy. Olaparib was administered at 400 mg twice per day. The primary efficacy end point was tumor response rate. A total of 298 patients received treatment and were evaluable. The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%). Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.;;The identification of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are expected to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy is of interest. We conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial of single-agent platinum for mTNBC with biomarker correlates. Patients with mTNBC received first- or second-line cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6) by physician's choice once every 3 weeks. Coprimary end points were objective response rate (RR) and response prediction by p63/p73 gene expression. Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not. Five of the six long-term responders alive at a median of 4.5 years lacked germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and two of them had increased tumor HRD-LOH/HRD-LST scores. Platinum agents are active in mTNBC, especially in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A measure of tumor DNA repair function may identify patients without mutations who could benefit from platinum therapy agents. Prospective controlled confirmatory trials are warranted.;;Wee1 tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and inactivates cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1/2 in response to DNA damage. AZD1775 is a first-in-class inhibitor of Wee1 kinase with single-agent antitumor activity in preclinical models. We conducted a phase I study of single-agent AZD1775 in adult patients with refractory solid tumors to determine its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and modulation of phosphorylated Tyr15-Cdk (pY15-Cdk) and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) levels in paired tumor biopsies. AZD1775 was administered orally twice per day over 2.5 days per week for up to 2 weeks per 21-day cycle (3 + 3 design). At the MTD, paired tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after the fifth dose to determine pY15-Cdk and γH2AX levels. Six patients with BRCA-mutant solid tumors were also enrolled at the MTD. Twenty-five patients were enrolled. The MTD was established as 225 mg twice per day orally over 2.5 days per week for 2 weeks per 21-day cycle. Confirmed partial responses were observed in two patients carrying BRCA mutations: one with head and neck cancer and one with ovarian cancer. Common toxicities were myelosuppression and diarrhea. Dose-limiting toxicities were supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and myelosuppression. Accumulation of drug (t1/2 approximately 11 hours) was observed. Reduction in pY15-Cdk levels (two of five paired biopsies) and increases in γH2AX levels (three of five paired biopsies) were demonstrated. This is the first report of AZD1775 single-agent activity in patients carrying BRCA mutations. Proof-of-mechanism was demonstrated by target modulation and DNA damage response in paired tumor biopsies.;;Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01682772; Cancer Research UK number, CRUK/11/029.).;;Cisplatin is synergistic with vinorelbine and the PARP inhibitor veliparib, and has antineoplastic activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer. This phase I study assessed veliparib with cisplatin and vinorelbine. A 3+3 dose-escalation design evaluated veliparib administered twice daily for 14 days with cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) day 1) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) days 1, 8) every 21 days, for 6 to 10 cycles, followed by veliparib monotherapy. Pharmacokinetics, measurement of poly(ADP-ribose) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and preliminary efficacy were assessed. IHC and gene-expression profiling were evaluated as potential predictors of response. Forty-five patients enrolled in nine dose cohorts plus five in an expansion cohort at the highest dose level and recommended phase II dose, 300 mg twice daily. The MTD of veliparib was not reached. Neutropenia (36%), anemia (30%), and thrombocytopenia (12%) were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events. Best overall response for 48 patients was radiologic response with 9-week confirmation for 17 (35%; 2 complete, 15 partial), and stable disease for 21 (44%). Germline BRCA mutation presence versus absence was associated with 6-month progression-free survival [PFS; 10 of 14 (71%) vs. 8 of 27 (30%), mid-P = 0.01]. Median PFS for all 50 patients was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval, 4.1-6.7). Veliparib at 300 mg twice daily combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine is well tolerated with encouraging response rates. A phase II randomized trial is planned to assess veliparib's contribution to cisplatin chemotherapy in metastatic TNBC and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer.

We sought to identify a therapeutic strategy to selectively target cancer cells harboring inactivating mutations of STAG2 using two independent pairs of isogenic glioblastoma cell lines containing either an endogenous mutant STAG2 allele or a wild-type STAG2 allele restored by homologous recombination. We find that mutations in STAG2 are associated with significantly increased sensitivity to inhibitors of the DNA repair enzyme PARP. STAG2-mutated, PARP-inhibited cells accumulated in G2 phase and had a higher percentage of micronuclei, fragmented nuclei, and chromatin bridges compared with wild-type STAG2 cells. We also observed more 53BP1 foci in STAG2-mutated glioblastoma cells, suggesting that these cells have defects in DNA repair. Furthermore, cells with mutations in STAG2 were more sensitive than cells with wild-type STAG2 when PARP inhibitors were used in combination with DNA-damaging agents. These data suggest that PARP is a potential target for tumors harboring inactivating mutations in STAG2, and strongly recommend that STAG2 status be determined and correlated with therapeutic response to PARP inhibitors, both prospectively and retrospectively, in clinical trials.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.;;Foretinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET, VEGF, RON, AXL, and TIE-2 receptors. Activating mutations or amplifications in MET have been described in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of foretinib in patients with PRCC. Patients were enrolled onto the study in two cohorts with different dosing schedules of foretinib: cohort A, 240 mg once per day on days 1 through 5 every 14 days (intermittent arm); cohort B, 80 mg daily (daily dosing arm). Patients were stratified on the basis of MET pathway activation (germline or somatic MET mutation, MET [7q31] amplification, or gain of chromosome 7). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Overall, 74 patients were enrolled, with 37 in each dosing cohort. ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 was 13.5%, median progression-free survival was 9.3 months, and median overall survival was not reached. The presence of a germline MET mutation was highly predictive of a response (five of 10 v five of 57 patients with and without germline MET mutations, respectively). The most frequent adverse events of any grade associated with foretinib were fatigue, hypertension, gastrointestinal toxicities, and nonfatal pulmonary emboli. Foretinib demonstrated activity in patients with advanced PRCC with a manageable toxicity profile and a high response rate in patients with germline MET mutations.

We hypothesized that protein kinase C (PKC) may provide new opportunities for therapeutic targeting of uveal melanoma carrying GNAQ mutations. To test this hypothesis, uveal melanoma cells harboring wild-type or mutant GNAQ were treated with the PKC inhibitor AEB071 (sotrastaurin) or infected with lentivirus-expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting PKC isoforms. Notably, AEB071 at low micromolar concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of uveal melanoma cells harboring GNAQ mutations through induction of G(1) arrest and apoptosis. However, AEB071 had little effect on uveal melanoma cells carrying wild-type GNAQ. AEB071-mediated cell inhibition in the GNAQ-mutated uveal melanoma was accompanied by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 phosphorylation, NF-κB, decreased expression of cyclin D1, survivin, Bcl-xL, and XIAP, and increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). AEB071 suppressed the expression of PKC α, β, δ, ε, and θ in GNAQ-mutated uveal melanoma cells. Our findings from shRNA-mediated knockdown studies revealed that these PKC isoforms are functionally important for uveal melanoma cells harboring GNAQ mutations. Furthermore, inhibitors of Erk1/2 and NF-κB pathways reduced viability of uveal melanoma cells. Together, our findings show that AEB071 exerts antitumor action on uveal melanoma cells carrying GNAQ mutations via targeting PKC/Erk1/2 and PKC/NF-κB pathways. Targeted PKC inhibition with drugs such as AEB071 offers novel therapeutic potential for uveal melanoma harboring GNAQ mutations.,,GNAQ mutations at codon 209 have been recently identified in approximately 50% of uveal melanomas (UM) and are reported to be oncogenic through activating the MAPK/Erk1/2 pathway. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a component of signaling from GNAQ to Erk1/2. Inhibition of PKC might regulate GNAQ mutation-induced Erk1/2 activation, resulting in growth inhibition of UM cells carrying GNAQ mutations. UM cells carrying wild type or mutant GNAQ were treated with the PKC inhibitor enzastaurin. Effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and signaling events were evaluated. Enzastaurin downregulated the expression of several PKC isoforms including PKCβII PKCθ, PKCε and/or their phosphorylation in GNAQ mutated cells. Downregulation of these PKC isoforms in GNAQ mutated cells by shRNA resulted in reduced viability. Enzastaurin exhibited greater antiproliferative effect on GNAQ mutant cells than wild type cells through induction of G1 arrest and apoptosis. Enzastaurin-induced G1 arrest was associated with inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, downregulation of cyclin D1, and accumulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Furthermore, enzastaurin reduced the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and survivin in GNAQ mutant cells. Inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation with a MEK specific inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity of GNAQ wild type cells to enzastaurin, accompanied by p27(Kip1) accumulation and/or inhibition of enzastaurin-induced survivin and Bcl-2 upregulation. PKC inhibitors such as enzastaurin have activity against UM cells carrying GNAQ mutations through inhibition of the PKC/Erk1/2 pathway and induction of G1 arrest and apoptosis. Inhibition of the PKC pathway provides a basis for clinical investigation in patients with UM.;;Activating Q209L/P mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 (GNAQ/11) are present in approximately 80% of uveal melanomas. Mutant GNAQ/11 are not currently therapeutically targetable. Inhibiting key down-stream effectors of GNAQ/11 represents a rational therapeutic approach for uveal melanomas that harbor these mutations. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK) and PI3K/AKT pathways are activated in uveal melanoma. In this study, we test the effect of the clinically relevant small molecule inhibitors GSK1120212 (MEK inhibitor) and GSK2126458 (pan class I PI3K inhibitor) on uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds. We use the largest set of genetically annotated uveal melanoma cell lines to date to carry out in vitro cellular signaling, cell-cycle regulation, growth, and apoptosis analyses. RNA interference and small molecule MEK and/or PI3K inhibitor treatment were used to determine the dependency of uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds on MEK/MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT signaling. Proteomic network analysis was done to unveil signaling alterations in response to MEK and/or PI3K small molecule inhibition. GNAQ/11 mutation status was not a determinant of whether cells would undergo cell-cycle arrest or growth inhibition to MEK and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition. A reverse correlation was observed between MAPK and AKT phosphorylation after MEK or PI3K inhibition, respectively. Neither MEK nor PI3K inhibition alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis in the majority of cell lines; however, the combination of MEK + PI3K inhibitor treatment resulted in the marked induction of apoptosis in a GNAQ/11 mutant-dependent manner. MEK + PI3K inhibition may be an effective combination therapy in uveal melanoma, given the inherent reciprocal activation of these pathways within these cells.,,Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.	;;;;Wu X. et al.,Mol.

For this purpose, we profiled the mutational landscape across 1,319 cancer-associated genes of 67 distinct cell lines and identified numerous genes involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PAXIP, and RAD50, as being associated with non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs. Mutations in the mismatch repair gene MSH3, which have been reported to occur recurrently in numerous human cancer entities, emerged as the most significant predictors of DNA-PKcs addiction. Concordantly, DNA-PKcs inhibition robustly induced apoptosis in MSH3-mutant cell lines in vitro and displayed remarkable single-agent efficacy against MSH3-mutant tumors in vivo. Thus, we here identify a therapeutically actionable synthetic lethal interaction between MSH3 and the non-homologous end joining kinase DNA-PKcs. Our observations recommend DNA-PKcs inhibition as a therapeutic concept for the treatment of human cancers displaying homologous recombination defects.	Dietlein F. et al.,Cancer Discov,2014

Although previous studies showed that loss of PBRM1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of renal cell carcinoma, these studies were performed on earlier stage, surgically resected renal cell carcinoma. Accordingly we investigated the PBRM1 expression profile in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma to determine the prognostic and predictive value of PBRM1. A total of 53 patients with stage IV or recurrent renal cell carcinoma were included in analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PBRM1 using formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue microarrays. Overall 25 of 53 patients (47%) had high PBRM1 expression in the tumor. On analysis comparing survival rates and treatment responses of patients with renal cell carcinoma high PBRM1 expression in the tumor was associated with reduced overall survival (mean ± SD 45.0 ± 4.8 vs 23.0 ± 8.3 months, p = 0.022, and for clear cell renal cell carcinoma 46.0 ± 4.1 vs 27.0 ± 6.7 months, p = 0.053). Regarding treatment outcome higher PBRM1 expression tended to indicate a poorer response to mTOR inhibitor (median progression-free survival 3.0 ± 0.2 vs 1.9 ± 2.3 months, p = 0.101). On subgroup analysis according to the Heng score this trend was more significant in the higher risk group than in the low risk group (progression-free survival for low risk mean 11.6 ± 1.2 vs 7.4 ± 7.4 months, p = 0.157, and for intermediate risk 7.1 ± 24.7 vs 2.9 ± 0.9 months, p = 0.060). Our study shows that the PBRM1 expression level is a potential prognostic marker for advanced renal cell carcinoma. We suggest that determining the tumor PBRM1 expression level may be used to inform the prognosis and treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.;;Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to have bona fide tumor suppressor activity. However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity. These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of EZH2. ;;Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to have bona fide tumor suppressor activity.

We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs.;;Angiomyolipomas are slow-growing tumours associated with constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The insidious growth of these tumours predisposes patients to serious complications including retroperitoneal haemorrhage and impaired renal function. Everolimus, a rapamycin derivative, inhibits the mTOR pathway by acting on the mTOR complex 1. We compared the angiomyolipoma response rate on everolimus with placebo in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphanioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomata. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with at least one angiomyolipoma 3 cm or larger in its longest diameter (defined by radiological assessment) and a definite diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 fashion with the use of an interactive web response system, to receive oral everolimus 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response of at least a 50% reduction in total volume of target angiomyolipomas relative to baseline. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00790400. 118 patients (median age 31·0 years; IQR 18·0–61·0) from 24 centres in 11 countries were randomly assigned to receive everolimus (n=79) or placebo (n=39). At the data cutoff, double-blind treatment was ongoing for 98 patients; two main reasons for discontination were disease progression (nine placebo patients) followed by adverse events (two everolimus patients; four placebo patients). The angiomyolipoma response rate was 42% (33 of 79 [95% CI 31–53%]) for everolimus and 0% (0 of 39 [0–9%]) for placebo (response rate difference 42% [24–58%]; one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p<0·0001). The most common adverse events in the everolimus and placebo groups were stomatitis (48% [38 of 79], 8% [3 of 39], respectively), nasopharyngitis (24% [19 of 79] and 31% [12 of 39]), and acne-like skin lesions (22% [17 of 79] and 5% [2 of 39]). Everolimus reduced angiomyolipoma volume with an acceptable safety profile, suggesting it could be a potential treatment for angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis. Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,Renal angiomyolipomas are a frequent manifestation of tuberous sclerosis and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). These disorders are associated with mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 that lead to overactivation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), suggesting an opportunity for targeted therapy by using mTORC1 inhibitors. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the mTORC1 inhibitor sirolimus for treatment of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with these disorders. In this multicenter phase 2 nonrandomized open label trial, 16 patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM and renal angiomyolipoma(s) were treated with oral sirolimus for up to 2 years. Steady-state blood levels were 3 to 10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was change in size of renal angiomyolipomas measured by MRI and assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Secondary outcomes included safety, neurocognitive function, and pulmonary function. The response rate, by RECIST criteria, was 50%. Summated angiomyolipoma diameters were reduced in all 16 patients and by 30% or more in eight (all from the per protocol group of 10). Forty-one of 48 angiomyolipomas were smaller at the last measurement than at baseline. Most shrinkage occurred during the first year of treatment. There was little change in pulmonary function. Recall memory improved in seven of eight patients with tuberous sclerosis. Adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of sirolimus. This study showed sustained regression of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM receiving 2 years of sirolimus treatment. Possible effects on pulmonary function and neurocognition require further investigation.,,PURPOSE Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) represent a family of mesenchymal neoplasms, mechanistically linked through activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. There is no known effective therapy for PEComa, and the molecular pathophysiology of aberrant mTOR signaling provided us with a scientific rationale to target this pathway therapeutically. On this mechanistic basis, we treated three consecutive patients with metastatic PEComa with an oral mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with advanced PEComa were treated with sirolimus and consented to retrospective collection of data from their medical records and analysis of archival tumor specimens. Tumor response was determined by computed tomography scans obtained at the clinical discretion of the treating physicians. Tumors were assessed for immunohistochemical evidence of mTORC1 activation and genetic evidence of alterations in TSC1 and TSC2. Results Radiographic responses to sirolimus were observed in all patients. PEComas demonstrated loss of TSC2 protein expression and evidence of baseline mTORC1 activation. Homozygous loss of TSC1 was identified in one PEComa. CONCLUSION Inhibition of mTORC1, pathologically activated by loss of the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, is a rational mechanistic target for therapy in PEComas. The clinical activity of sirolimus in PEComa additionally strengthens the pathobiologic similarities linking PEComas to other neoplasms related to the tuberous sclerosis complex.;;Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive cystic lung disease affecting some women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Sporadic LAM can develop in women without TSC, owing to somatic mutations in the TSC2 gene. Accumulating evidence supports the view of LAM as a low-grade, destructive, metastasizing neoplasm. The mechanisms underlying the metastatic capability of LAM cells remain poorly understood. The observed behavior of LAM cells with respect to their infiltrative growth pattern, metastatic potential, and altered cell differentiation bears similarity to cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, we report increased levels of active Src kinase in LAM lungs and in TSC2(-/-) cells, caused by a reduction of autophagy. Furthermore, increased Src kinase activation promoted migration, invasion, and inhibition of E-cadherin expression in TSC2(-/-) cells by upregulating the transcription factor Snail. Notably, Src kinase inhibitors reduced migration and invasion properties of TSC2(-/-) cells and attenuated lung colonization of intravenously injected TSC2(-/-) cells in vivo to a greater extent than control TSC2(+/+) cells.

Sporadic LAM can develop in women without TSC, owing to somatic mutations in the TSC2 gene. Accumulating evidence supports the view of LAM as a low-grade, destructive, metastasizing neoplasm. The mechanisms underlying the metastatic capability of LAM cells remain poorly understood. The observed behavior of LAM cells with respect to their infiltrative growth pattern, metastatic potential, and altered cell differentiation bears similarity to cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, we report increased levels of active Src kinase in LAM lungs and in TSC2(-/-) cells, caused by a reduction of autophagy. Furthermore, increased Src kinase activation promoted migration, invasion, and inhibition of E-cadherin expression in TSC2(-/-) cells by upregulating the transcription factor Snail.

Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.

This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.	Banerji S. et al.,Nature,2012

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.;;PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy. METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 (BRIM-2), patients received oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice per day). Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, cell-cycle progression, and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing, or somatic mutation profiling. Results Vemurafenib inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression. An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies (n = 22; P = .013). Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response. Baseline mutations in MEK1(P124) coexisting with BRAF(V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary NRAS(Q61) mutations or MEK1(Q56P) or MEK1(E203K) mutations. These two activating MEK1 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors. CONCLUSION Vemurafenib inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic BRAF signaling through the MAPK pathway. Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS and MEK1 in subsets of patients. The data suggest that inhibition downstream of BRAF should help to overcome acquired resistance.;;The identification of somatic genetic alterations that confer sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibitors has led to new cancer therapies. To identify mutations that confer an exceptional dependency, shRNA-based loss-of-function data were analyzed from a dataset of numerous cell lines to reveal genes that are essential in a small subset of cancer cell lines. Once these cell lines were determined, detailed genomic characterization from these cell lines was utilized to ascertain the genomic aberrations that led to this extreme dependency. This method, in a large subset of lung cancer cell lines, yielded a single lung adenocarcinoma cell line, NCI-H1437, which is sensitive to RNA interference of MAP2K1 expression. Notably, NCI-H1437 is the only lung cancer cell line included in the dataset with a known activating mutation in MAP2K1 (Q56P). Subsequent validation using shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 confirmed MAP2K1 dependency. In vitro and in vivo inhibitor studies established that NCI-H1437 cells are sensitive to MEK1 inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug trametinib. Like NCI-H1437 cells, the MAP2K1-mutant cell lines SNU-C1 (colon) and OCUM-1 (gastric) showed decreased viability after MAP2K1 depletion via Cas9-mediated gene editing. Similarly, these cell lines were particularly sensitive to trametinib treatment compared with control cell lines. On the basis of these data, cancers that harbor driver mutations in MAP2K1 could benefit from treatment with MEK1 inhibitors. Furthermore, this functional data mining approach provides a general method to experimentally test genomic features that confer dependence in tumors. Cancers with an activated RAS/MAPK pathway driven by oncogenic MAP2K1 mutations may be particularly sensitive to MEK1 inhibitor treatments.	Emery CM. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Originally discovered in congenital fibrosarcomas with t(12;15) translocations, EN was identified subsequently in secretory breast carcinoma (SBC) which represent a variant of invasive ductal carcinoma.

In this study, we analyzed EN expressing murine and human mammary epithelial cell lines for transformation properties. Various IGF1R signaling inhibitors, including the dual specificity IGF1R/insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor BMS-536924, were then tested for effects on three-dimensional Matrigel cell growth, migration, and tumor formation. We found that EN expression increased acinar size and luminal filling in Matrigel cultures and promoted orthotopic tumor growth in mice.

Whole-exome sequencing of a patient with a 14-month complete response on this trial revealed two concurrent mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus. In vitro experiments demonstrate that both mutations are activating, suggesting a biologic mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus in this patient.

Here, we show that somatic mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) tyrosine kinase gene, FGFR2, are present in 12% of endometrial carcinomas, with additional instances found in lung squamous cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma. These FGFR2 mutations, many of which are identical to mutations associated with congenital craniofacial developmental disorders, are constitutively activated and oncogenic when ectopically expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Inhibition of FGFR2 kinase activity in endometrial carcinoma cell lines bearing such FGFR2 mutations inhibits transformation and survival, implicating FGFR2 as a novel therapeutic target in endometrial carcinoma.,,Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family of kinases (FGFR1-4) are dysregulated in multiple cancers. Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against BCR-ABL. Ponatinib has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs, prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express activated FGFR1-4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells. In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, gastric, breast, lung, and colon) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) (concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10-30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined. Importantly, the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in BCR-ABL-driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for FGFR1-4 inhibition can be sustained in patients. These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers.,,Patient stratification biomarkers that enable the translation of cancer genetic knowledge into clinical use are essential for the successful and rapid development of emerging targeted anticancer therapeutics. Here, we describe the identification of patient stratification biomarkers for NVP-BGJ398, a novel and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor. By intersecting genome-wide gene expression and genomic alteration data with cell line-sensitivity data across an annotated collection of cancer cell lines called the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we show that genetic alterations for FGFR family members predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398. For the first time, we report oncogenic FGFR1 amplification in osteosarcoma as a potential patient selection biomarker. Furthermore, we show that cancer cell lines harboring FGF19 copy number gain at the 11q13 amplicon are sensitive to NVP-BGJ398 only when concomitant expression of β-klotho occurs. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors in selected patients with cancer harboring tumors with the identified predictors of sensitivity. The success of a personalized medicine approach using targeted therapies ultimately depends on being able to identify the patients who will benefit the most from any given drug. To this end, we have integrated the molecular profiles for more than 500 cancer cell lines with sensitivity data for the novel anticancer drug NVP-BGJ398 and showed that FGFR genetic alterations are the most significant predictors for sensitivity. This work has ultimately endorsed the incorporation of specific patient selection biomakers in the clinical trials for NVP-BGJ398.	Dutt A. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We conducted whole-exome sequencing and identified Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) somatic-activating mutations (A572V and A573V) in 2 of 4 patients with NKTCLs. Further validation of the prevalence of JAK3 mutations was determined by Sanger sequencing and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis in an additional 61 cases. In total, 23 of 65 (35.4%) cases harbored JAK3 mutations. Functional characterization of the JAK3 mutations support its involvement in cytokine-independent JAK/STAT constitutive activation leading to increased cell growth. Moreover, treatment of both JAK3-mutant and wild-type NKTCL cell lines with a novel pan-JAK inhibitor, CP-690550, resulted in dose-dependent reduction of phosphorylated STAT5, reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis. Hence, targeting the deregulated JAK/STAT pathway could be a promising therapy for patients with NKTCLs. Gene mutations causing NKTCL have not been fully identified. Through exome sequencing, we identified activating mutations of JAK3 that may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of NKTCLs. Our findings have important implications for the management of patients with NKTCLs.	Koo GC. et al.,Cancer Discov,2012

The mutations reside in the extracellular domain of ALK and are potently transforming in cytokine-independent cellular assays and primary mouse bone marrow colony formation studies. Strikingly, both mutations conferred sensitivity to ALK kinase inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug crizotinib.

We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas.	Prickett TD. et al.,Nat. Genet.,2009

Resistance to crizotinib developed in a patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring a CD74-ROS1 rearrangement who had initially shown a dramatic response to treatment. We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding. The same resistance mutation was observed at all the metastatic sites that were examined at autopsy, suggesting that this mutation was an early event in the clonal evolution of resistance. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).,,Although ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to crizotinib, development of resistance is inevitable. Here, we identified molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients with the CD74-ROS1 rearrangement, and in HCC78 cells harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 that showed resistance to crizotinib (HCC78CR cells). ROS1 kinase domain mutations were examined in fresh tumor tissues from two NSCLC patients and HCC78CR1-3 cells by direct sequencing. Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 secondary mutations were constructed to evaluate resistance to crizotinib. An upregulated pathway was identified using phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, EGFR signaling antibody array, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cell proliferation and ROS1 downstream signaling pathways were compared between HCC78 and HCC78CR1-3 cells. The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in crizotinib-resistant tumors from one patient. Furthermore, HCC78CR1 and CR2 cells harbored a novel ROS1 L2155S mutation (73.3% and 76.2%, respectively). ROS1 G2032R and L2155S mutations conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was observed in HCC78CR1-2 cells and in the other patient. RNA-seq and EGFR signaling antibody array revealed that the EGFR pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC78CR3 versus HCC78 cells. Cells with the ROS1 mutation and upregulated EGFR were sensitive to foretinib, an inhibitor of c-MET, VEGFR2, and ROS1 and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus crizotinib, respectively. Molecular changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC are heterogeneous, including ROS1 tyrosine kinase mutations, EGFR activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.;;ROS1 rearrangement leads to constitutive ROS1 activation with potent transforming activity. In an ongoing phase I trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ROS1 fusions; however, cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in ROS1. Thus, understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required. The sensitivity of CD74-ROS1-transformed Ba/F3 cells to multiple ALK inhibitors was examined. Acquired ROS1 inhibitor-resistant mutations in CD74-ROS1 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3 cells. To overcome the resistance mutation, we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials. The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the CD74-ROS1-mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74-ROS1. We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain, including the G2032R mutation. As the result of high-throughput drug screening, we found that the cMET/RET/VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184) effectively inhibited the survival of CD74-ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations. We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.

Ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activation have been implicated in a broad range of human malignancies and promote cancer progression in tumors driven by FGF/FGFR oncogenic mutations or amplifications, tumor neoangiogenesis, and targeted treatment resistance, thereby supporting a strong rationale for anti-FGF/FGFR agent development. Efforts are being pursued to develop selective approaches for use against this pathway by optimizing the management of emerging, class-specific toxicity profiles and correctly designing clinical trials to address these different issues.;;Lucitanib is a potent, oral inhibitor fibroblast growth factor receptor types 1 and 2 (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor types 1, 2, and 3 (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor types α and β (PGFRα/β), which are essential kinases for tumor growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors. This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive). Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t½ was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients. Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.;;Purpose This two-part, first-in-human study was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the schedule, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of oral BGJ398, a selective FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with escalating dosages of BGJ398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR1-amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82.5%), constipation (50.9%), decreased appetite (45.6%), and stomatitis (45.6%). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (RP2D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off (50.0%) versus the continuous (73.7%) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ398 at the MTD/RP2D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancers.	,,;;;;Dieci MV. et al.,Cancer Discov,2013;;Soria JC. et al.,Ann.

The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.

Mechanisms of immune escape in this context are unknown. We analyzed biopsy samples from paired baseline and relapsing lesions in four patients with metastatic melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression in response to anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease progression months to years later. Whole-exome sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the acquired resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients, revealed resistance-associated loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding interferon-receptor-associated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the wild-type allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the antigen-presenting protein beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncating mutations resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including insensitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. The B2M truncating mutation led to loss of surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I. In this study, acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in patients with melanoma was associated with defects in the pathways involved in interferon-receptor signaling and in antigen presentation.

Deregulation of cell cycle kinases, e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can initiate a hyper-proliferative cell phenotype and cause genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation. Pharmacological agents targeting CDKs have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents for over 20 years, evolving from early pan-CDK inhibitors to second-generation inhibitors with much greater specificity and selectivity. Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful preclinical investigations, CDK inhibitors have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical trials. In addition, inhibitors of other cell cycle kinases are currently progressing through clinical trials.

MRT are almost exclusively characterized by homozygous deletion or inactivation of the chromatin remodeling gene SMARCB1 SMARCB1 protein loss leads to direct impairment of chromatin remodeling and we have previously reported a role for this protein in histone acetylation. This provided the rationale for investigating the therapeutic potential of histone deactylase inhibitors (HDACi) in MRT. Whereas previously HDACis have been used at doses and schedules that induce cytotoxicity, in the current studies we have tested the hypothesis, both in vitro and in vivo, that sustained treatment of human MRT with low-dose HDACi can lead to sustained cell growth arrest and differentiation. Sustained low-dose panobinostat (LBH589) treatment led to changes in cellular morphology associated with a marked increase in the induction of neural, renal, and osteoblast differentiation pathways. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling highlighted differential gene expression supporting multilineage differentiation. Using mouse xenograft models, sustained low-dose LBH589 treatment caused tumor growth arrest associated with tumor calcification detectable by X-ray imaging. Histological analysis of LBH589-treated tumors revealed significant regions of ossification, confirmed by Alizarin Red staining. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased TUJ1 and PAX2 staining suggestive of neuronal and renal differentiation, respectively. Low-dose HDACi treatment can terminally differentiate MRT tumor cells and reduce their ability to self-renew. The use of low-dose HDACi as a novel therapeutic approach warrants further investigation.

These mutations recurrently affect specific amino acid residues, leading to perturbed normal splice site and exon recognition. Spliceosomal gene mutations are always heterozygous and rarely occur together with one another, suggesting that cells may tolerate only a partial deviation from normal splicing activity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered mice to express a mutated allele of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (Srsf2(P95H))-which commonly occurs in individuals with MDS and AML-in an inducible, hemizygous manner in hematopoietic cells. These mice rapidly succumbed to fatal bone marrow failure, demonstrating that Srsf2-mutated cells depend on the wild-type Srsf2 allele for survival. In the context of leukemia, treatment with the spliceosome inhibitor E7107 (refs. 7,8) resulted in substantial reductions in leukemic burden, specifically in isogenic mouse leukemias and patient-derived xenograft AMLs carrying spliceosomal mutations. Whereas E7107 treatment of mice resulted in widespread intron retention and cassette exon skipping in leukemic cells regardless of Srsf2 genotype, the magnitude of splicing inhibition following E7107 treatment was greater in Srsf2-mutated than in Srsf2-wild-type leukemia, consistent with the differential effect of E7107 on survival. Collectively, these data provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that leukemias with spliceosomal gene mutations are preferentially susceptible to additional splicing perturbations in vivo as compared to leukemias without such mutations. Modulation of spliceosome function may thus provide a new therapeutic avenue in genetically defined subsets of individuals with MDS or AML.	Lee SC. et al.,Nat. Med.,2016

The current analysis aimed to identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment. Archival tumor samples from patients in BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 were analyzed using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Sanger sequencing. Biomarker data were available for 549 patients. PIK3CA activating mutations and PTEN loss were reported in 30% and 16% of BOLERO-1 samples and in 32% and 12% of BOLERO-3 samples, respectively. PI3K pathway was hyperactive (PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss and/or AKT1 mutation) in 47% of BOLERO-1 and 41% of BOLERO-3 samples. In both studies, differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently observed in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing combined data sets of both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased hazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.00), PTEN loss (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93).

This analysis, although exploratory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer having tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or hyperactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus.

We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.	;;Jaiswal BS. et al.,Cancer Cell,2013;;Jaiswal BS. et al.,Cancer Cell,2013;;Jaiswal BS. et al.,Cancer Cell,2013;;Jaiswal BS. et al.,Cancer Cell,2013;;Jaiswal BS. et al.,Cancer Cell,2013;;Choudhury NJ. et al.,J.

Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins undergo massive constitutive stabilization specifically in tumours, which is the key requisite for the acquisition of gain-of-functions activities. Although currently 11 million patients worldwide live with tumours expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is unknown whether mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo. Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model expressing an inactivatable R248Q hotspot mutation (floxQ) to show that tumours depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon tamoxifen-induced mutp53 ablation, allotransplanted and autochthonous tumours curb their growth, thus extending animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumours undergo apoptosis and tumour regression or stagnation. The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal tissues, is a major determinant of mutp53 stabilization. We show that long-term HSP90 inhibition significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/- (R248Q allele) and H/H (R172H allele) mice by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their corresponding p53(-/-) littermates. This mutp53-dependent drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with 17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/- mice treated with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of mutp53 degradation, tumour apoptosis and prevention of T-cell lymphomagenesis. These proof-of-principle data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug target. ;;Missense mutations in p53 generate aberrant proteins with abrogated tumour suppressor functions that can also acquire oncogenic gain-of-function activities that promote malignant progression, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.

Although currently 11 million patients worldwide live with tumours expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is unknown whether mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo. Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model expressing an inactivatable R248Q hotspot mutation (floxQ) to show that tumours depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon tamoxifen-induced mutp53 ablation, allotransplanted and autochthonous tumours curb their growth, thus extending animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumours undergo apoptosis and tumour regression or stagnation. The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal tissues, is a major determinant of mutp53 stabilization. We show that long-term HSP90 inhibition significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/- (R248Q allele) and H/H (R172H allele) mice by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their corresponding p53(-/-) littermates. This mutp53-dependent drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with 17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/- mice treated with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of mutp53 degradation, tumour apoptosis and prevention of T-cell lymphomagenesis. These proof-of-principle data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug target.	Alexandrova EM. et al.,Nature,2015;;Alexandrova EM. et al.,Nature,2015

Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.

To design new lines of treatment, the molecular landscape of resistant tumors must be ascertained. We investigated the role of mutations in the EGFR signaling axis on the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab in patients and cellular models. Tissue samples were obtained from 37 patients with colorectal cancer who became refractory to cetuximab. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance. The genetic profile of tumor specimens obtained after cetuximab treatment revealed the emergence of a complex pattern of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes, including two novel EGFR ectodomain mutations (R451C and K467T). Mutational profiling of cetuximab-resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR alleles: S464L, G465R, and I491M. Structurally, these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for the R451C mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab. Colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signaling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding. Both mechanisms of resistance may occur concomitantly. Our data have implications for designing additional lines of therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who relapse upon treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.	Arena S. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015

study examined the status of KRAS and BRAF mutations, in relation to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in 58 ovarian carcinomas to clarify the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of KRAS/BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations of either KRAS or BRAF were identified in 12 (20.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas. The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0% : 1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3% : 10/31). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas. KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II (P<0.001), and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.001). No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy (P=0.2460, P=0.9339, respectively). Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040. Cl-1040 is a compound that selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK), an upstream regulator of ERK1/2, and thus prevents ERK1/2 activation. Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences. This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment.;;Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

This seminal finding also highlighted our sparse knowledge about key signalling pathways in colorectal tumours. Drugs that inhibit oncogenic alterations such as phospho-MAP2K (also called MEK), phospho-AKT, and mutant B-RAF seem promising as single treatment or when given with EGFR inhibitors. However, our understanding of the precise role these potential drug targets have in colorectal tumours, and the oncogenic dependence that tumours might have on these components, has not progressed at the same rate. As a result, patient selection and prediction of treatment effects remain problematic. We review the role of mutations in genes other than KRAS on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, and discuss strategies to target these oncogenic alterations alone or in combination with receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibition.,,To investigate whether EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway mutations predicted response to monotherapy with panitumumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in a randomized phase III study of metastatic colorectal cancer. Using massively parallel multigene sequencing, we analyzed 320 samples for 9 genes, with multigene sequence data from 288 (90%) samples. Mutation rates were: KRAS (45%), NRAS (5%), BRAF (7%), PIK3CA (9%), PTEN (6%), TP53 (60%), EGFR (1%), AKT1 (<1%), and CTNNB1 (2%). In the randomized study and open-label extension, 22 of 138 (16%) wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients versus 0 of 103 mutant KRAS (codons 12/13) patients had objective responses. Of 6 mutant KRAS (codon 61) patients, 1 with a Q61H mutation achieved partial response during the extension. Among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients, 0 of 9 patients with NRAS mutations, 0 of 13 with BRAF mutations, 2 of 10 with PIK3CA mutations, 1 of 9 with PTEN mutations, and 1 of 2 with CTNNB1 mutations responded to panitumumab. No patients responded to best supportive care alone. Panitumumab treatment was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients [HR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.56]. Among wild-type KRAS patients, a treatment effect for PFS favoring panitumumab occurred in patients with wild-type NRAS (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.56) and wild-type BRAF (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.24-0.55) but not mutant NRAS (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.44-8.44).

These results show the feasibility and potential clinical use of next-generation sequencing for evaluating predictive biomarkers.;;Malignant astrocytomas (MA) are aggressive central nervous system tumors with poor prognosis. Activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) has been reported in a subset of these tumors, especially in children. We have investigated the incidence of BRAF(V600E) in additional pediatric patient cohorts and examined the effects of BRAF blockade in preclinical models of BRAF(V600E) and wild-type BRAF MA. BRAF(V600E) mutation status was examined in two pediatric MA patient cohorts. For functional studies, BRAF(V600E) MA cell lines were used to investigate the effects of BRAF shRNA knockdown in vitro, and to investigate BRAF pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. BRAF(V600E) mutations were identified in 11 and 10% of MAs from two distinct series of tumors (six of 58 cases total). BRAF was expressed in all MA cell lines examined, among which BRAF(V600E) was identified in four instances. Using the BRAF(V600E)-specific inhibitor PLX4720, pharmacologic blockade of BRAF revealed preferential antiproliferative activity against BRAF(V600E) mutant cells in vitro, in contrast to the use of shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF, which inhibited cell growth of glioma cell lines regardless of BRAF mutation status. Using orthotopic MA xenografts, we show that PLX4720 treatment decreases tumor growth and increases overall survival in mice-bearing BRAF(V600E) mutant xenografts, while being ineffective, and possibly tumor promoting, against xenografts with wild-type BRAF. Our results indicate a 10% incidence of activating BRAF(V600E) among pediatric MAs. With regard to implications for therapy, our results support evaluation of BRAF(V600E)-specific inhibitors for treating BRAF(V600E) MA patients.,,Although malignant astrocytomas are a leading cause of cancer-related death in children, rational therapeutic strategies are lacking. We previously identified activating mutations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) (BRAF(T1799A) encoding BRAF(V600E)) in association with homozygous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, encoding p14ARF and p16Ink4a) deletions in pediatric infiltrative astrocytomas. Here we report that BRAF(V600E) expression in neural progenitors (NPs) is insufficient for tumorigenesis and increases NP cellular differentiation as well as apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytomas are readily generated from NPs with additional Ink4a-Arf deletion. The BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 significantly increased survival of mice after intracranial transplant of genetically relevant murine or human astrocytoma cells. Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy. Our findings indicate a rational therapeutic strategy for treating a subset of pediatric astrocytomas with BRAF(V600E) mutation and CDKN2A deficiency.;;A multicenter, open-label, phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of selumetinib in iodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (IRPTC). Patients with advanced IRPTC with or without follicular elements and documented disease progression within the preceding 12 months were eligible to receive selumetinib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall survival, and progression-free survival (PFS). Tumor genotype including mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS was assessed. Best responses in 32 evaluable patients out of 39 enrolled were 1 partial response (3%), 21 stable disease (54%), and 11 progressive disease (28%). Disease stability maintenance occurred for 16 weeks in 49%, 24 weeks in 36%. Median PFS was 32 weeks. BRAF V600E mutants (12 of 26 evaluated, 46%) had a longer median PFS compared with patients with BRAF wild-type (WT) tumors (33 versus 11 weeks, respectively, HR = 0.6, not significant, P = 0.3). The most common adverse events and grades 3 to 4 toxicities included rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Two pulmonary deaths occurred in the study and were judged unlikely to be related to the study drug. Selumetinib was well tolerated but the study was negative with regard to the primary outcome. Secondary analyses suggest that future studies of selumetinib and other mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK) inhibitors in IRPTC should consider BRAF V600E mutation status in the trial design based on differential trends in outcome.;;The clinical use of BRAF inhibitors is being hampered by the acquisition of drug resistance. This study shows the potential therapeutic use of the HSP90 inhibitor (XL888) in six different models of vemurafenib resistance. The ability of XL888 to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis and tumor regression of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines was shown in vitro and in vivo. A novel mass spectrometry-based pharmacodynamic assay was developed to measure intratumoral HSP70 levels following HSP90 inhibition in melanoma cell lines, xenografts, and melanoma biopsies. Mechanistic studies were carried out to determine the mechanism of XL888-induced apoptosis. XL888 potently inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, and prevented the growth of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines in 3-dimensional cell culture, long-term colony formation assays, and human melanoma mouse xenografts. The reversal of the resistance phenotype was associated with the degradation of PDGFRβ, COT, IGFR1, CRAF, ARAF, S6, cyclin D1, and AKT, which in turn led to the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, an increase in BIM (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) expression, and the downregulation of Mcl-1. In most resistance models, XL888 treatment increased BIM expression, decreased Mcl-1 expression, and induced apoptosis more effectively than dual mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (MEK/PI3K) inhibition. HSP90 inhibition may be a highly effective strategy at managing the diverse array of resistance mechanisms being reported to BRAF inhibitors and appears to be more effective at restoring BIM expression and downregulating Mcl-1 expression than combined MEK/PI3K inhibitor therapy.;;Recent results from clinical trials with the BRAF inhibitors GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) and PLX4032 (vemurafenib) have shown encouraging response rates; however, the duration of response has been limited. To identify determinants of acquired resistance to GSK2118436 and strategies to overcome the resistance, we isolated GSK2118436 drug-resistant clones from the A375 BRAF(V600E) and the YUSIT1 BRAF(V600K) melanoma cell lines. These clones also showed reduced sensitivity to the allosteric mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor GSK1120212 (trametinib). Genetic characterization of these clones identified an in-frame deletion in MEK1 (MEK1(K59del)) or NRAS mutation (NRAS(Q61K) and/or NRAS(A146T)) with and without MEK1(P387S) in the BRAF(V600E) background and NRAS(Q61K) in the BRAF(V600K) background. Stable knockdown of NRAS with short hairpin RNA partially restored GSK2118436 sensitivity in mutant NRAS clones, whereas expression of NRAS(Q61K) or NRAS(A146T) in the A375 parental cells decreased sensitivity to GSK2118436. Similarly, expression of MEK1(K59del), but not MEK1(P387S), decreased sensitivity of A375 cells to GSK2118436. The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 effectively inhibited cell growth, decreased ERK phosphorylation, decreased cyclin D1 protein, and increased p27(kip1) protein in the resistant clones. Moreover, the combination of GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458 enhanced cell growth inhibition and decreased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation in these clones. Our results show that NRAS and/or MEK mutations contribute to BRAF inhibitor resistance in vitro, and the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 overcomes this resistance. In addition, these resistant clones respond to the combination of GSK2126458 with GSK2118436 or GSK1120212. Clinical trials are ongoing or planned to test these combinations.,,BRAF is an attractive target for melanoma drug development. However, resistance to BRAF inhibitors is a significant clinical challenge. We describe a model of resistance to BRAF inhibitors developed by chronic treatment of BRAF(V)⁶⁰⁰(E) melanoma cells with the BRAF inhibitor SB-590885; these cells are cross-resistant to other BRAF-selective inhibitors. Resistance involves flexible switching among the three RAF isoforms, underscoring the ability of melanoma cells to adapt to pharmacological challenges. IGF-1R/PI3K signaling was enhanced in resistant melanomas, and combined treatment with IGF-1R/PI3K and MEK inhibitors induced death of BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells. Increased IGF-1R and pAKT levels in a post-relapse human tumor sample are consistent with a role for IGF-1R/PI3K-dependent survival in the development of resistance to BRAF inhibitors.;;Although malignant astrocytomas are a leading cause of cancer-related death in children, rational therapeutic strategies are lacking. We previously identified activating mutations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) (BRAF(T1799A) encoding BRAF(V600E)) in association with homozygous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, encoding p14ARF and p16Ink4a) deletions in pediatric infiltrative astrocytomas.

Our findings indicate a rational therapeutic strategy for treating a subset of pediatric astrocytomas with BRAF(V600E) mutation and CDKN2A deficiency.;;Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF kinase that is selective for mutant BRAF. We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases. We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321. We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions. In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-melanoma solid tumours, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, papillary thyroid cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer.

GlaxoSmithKline.,,The identification of somatic mutations in the gene encoding the serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) in the majority of melanomas offers an opportunity to test oncogene-targeted therapy for this disease. We conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor of mutated BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the maximum dose that could be administered without adverse effects (the recommended phase 2 dose). Patients received PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease progression. Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments were conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy was performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF inhibition. A total of 55 patients (49 of whom had melanoma) were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, and 32 additional patients with metastatic melanoma who had BRAF with the V600E mutation were enrolled in the extension phase. The recommended phase 2 dose was 960 mg twice daily, with increases in the dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. In the dose-escalation cohort, among the 16 patients with melanoma whose tumors carried the V600E BRAF mutation and who were receiving 240 mg or more of PLX4032 twice daily, 10 had a partial response and 1 had a complete response. Among the 32 patients in the extension cohort, 24 had a partial response and 2 had a complete response. The estimated median progression-free survival among all patients was more than 7 months. Treatment of metastatic melanoma with PLX4032 in patients with tumors that carry the V600E BRAF mutation resulted in complete or partial tumor regression in the majority of patients. (Funded by Plexxikon and Roche Pharmaceuticals.),,Clinical benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is disappointing, and effective therapeutic approaches for these patients are urgently needed. Because kinase-activating mutations in the BRAF proto-oncogene commonly occur in advanced PTC, and inhibition of BRAF(V600E) has shown promising clinical activity in melanoma, BRAF inhibitor therapy may be an effective strategy to treat metastatic PTC. The dose escalation portion of a first-in-human, phase I study of vemurafenib, a selective RAF inhibitor, included three patients with metastatic PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Vemurafenib was initially dosed at 240-360 mg twice a day, later escalated to 720 mg twice a day. Response evaluation was performed every 8 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Among the three patients, one had a confirmed partial response with reduction of pulmonary target lesions by 31%, and the duration of response was 7.6 months before the disease progressed in the lungs and the bones. The time to progression was 11.7 months. The other two patients had stable disease, and the time to progression was 13.2 and 11.4 months, respectively. Vemurafenib appears to have a promising clinical activity in patients with metastatic PTC, and our data suggest that the BRAF(V600E) mutant kinase is a relevant target for therapy in this patient population. Further investigation of inhibitors of mutated BRAF kinase in patients with PTC in a phase II study is warranted.;;,,,,In multiple myeloma, there has been little progress in the specific therapeutic targeting of oncogenic mutations. Whole-genome sequencing data have recently revealed that a subset of patients carry an activating mutation (V600E) in the BRAF kinase. To uncover the clinical relevance of this mutation in multiple myeloma, we correlated the mutation status in primary tumor samples from 379 patients with myeloma with disease outcome. We found a significantly higher incidence of extramedullary disease and a shorter overall survival in mutation carriers when compared with controls. Most importantly, we report on a patient with confirmed BRAF V600E mutation and relapsed myeloma with extensive extramedullary disease, refractory to all approved therapeutic options, who has rapidly and durably responded to low doses of the mutation-specific BRAF inhibitor vermurafenib. Collectively, we provide evidence for the development of the BRAF V600E mutation in the context of clonal evolution and describe the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of this targetable mutation. ;;Acquired resistance to EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is inevitable in metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers. Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.;;Resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibitors is associated with reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at different levels in melanoma. To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAF(V600E) promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). These effects were antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of CDKN2C and CDKN1A targets CDK2 and CDK4 in vitro. In contrast to BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   )-expressing melanocytes, melanoma cells have an inherent resistance to suppression of AP-1 activity by BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors. Here, CDK2/4 inhibition statistically significantly augmented the effects of BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors on melanoma cell viability in vitro and growth in athymic nude Foxn1   (   nu   ) mice (P = .03 when mean tumor volume at day 13 was compared for BRAF(V600E) inhibitor vs BRAF(V600E) inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P = .02 when mean tumor volume was compared for MEK inhibitor vs MEK inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P values were calculated by a two-sided Welch t test; n = 4-8 mice per group).;;Activating oncogenic mutations of BRAF have been described in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but treatment of GIST with BRAF inhibitors and mechanisms of mediating the emergence of resistance in GIST have not been reported. Dabrafenib is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of BRAF kinase and is highly selective for mutant BRAF in kinase panel screening, cell lines, and xenografts. We report prolonged antitumor activity in the first patient with V600E BRAF-mutated GIST who was treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Whole exome sequencing performed in tumor tissue obtained at the time of progressive disease demonstrated a somatic gain-of-function PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) as well as a CDKN2A aberration, which may have contributed to eventual resistance to treatment.,,Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF kinase that is selective for mutant BRAF. We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases. We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321. We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions. In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-melanoma solid tumours, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, papillary thyroid cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. Dabrafenib is safe in patients with solid tumours, and an active inhibitor of Val600-mutant BRAF with responses noted in patients with melanoma, brain metastases, and other solid tumours.

GlaxoSmithKline.,,,,,,The identification of somatic mutations in the gene encoding the serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) in the majority of melanomas offers an opportunity to test oncogene-targeted therapy for this disease. We conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor of mutated BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the maximum dose that could be administered without adverse effects (the recommended phase 2 dose). Patients received PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease progression. Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments were conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy was performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF inhibition. A total of 55 patients (49 of whom had melanoma) were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, and 32 additional patients with metastatic melanoma who had BRAF with the V600E mutation were enrolled in the extension phase.

Further investigation of inhibitors of mutated BRAF kinase in patients with PTC in a phase II study is warranted.,,Activating BRAF(V600E) (Val600Glu) mutations are found in about 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas, which might provide an opportunity for targeted treatment in these patients. Dabrafenib is an oral selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase. We did a trial to assess the clinical activity of dabrafenib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) positive for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In this phase 2, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, we enrolled previously treated and untreated patients with stage IV metastatic BRAF(V600E)-positive NSCLC. Patients received oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, which was assessed in patients who had received at least one dose of dabrafenib; safety was also assessed in this population. The study is ongoing but not enrolling patients in this cohort. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634. Between Aug 3, 2011, and Feb 25, 2014, 84 patients were enrolled, six of whom had not previously received systemic treatment for NSCLC. 26 of the 78 previously treated patients achieved an investigator-assessed overall response (33% [95% CI 23-45]). Four of the six previously untreated patients had an objective response. One patient died from an intracranial haemorrhage that was judged by the investigator to be due to the study drug. Serious adverse events were reported in 35 (42%) of 84 patients. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma in ten (12%), asthenia in four (5%), and basal-cell carcinoma in four (5%). Dabrafenib showed clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-positive NSCLC. Our findings suggest that dabrafenib could represent a treatment option for a population of patients with limited therapeutic options. GlaxoSmithKline.;;The high frequency of activating RAS or BRAF mutations in cancer provides strong rationale for targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors. ,,Resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibitors is associated with reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at different levels in melanoma. To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun.

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01524978.).;;To evaluate dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, combined with trametinib, a selective MEK inhibitor, in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 43 patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC were treated with dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2 mg daily), 17 of whom were enrolled onto a pharmacodynamic cohort undergoing mandatory biopsies before and during treatment. Archival tissues were analyzed for microsatellite instability, PTEN status, and 487-gene sequencing. Patient-derived xenografts were established from core biopsy samples. Of 43 patients, five (12%) achieved a partial response or better, including one (2%) complete response, with duration of response > 36 months; 24 patients (56%) achieved stable disease as best confirmed response. Ten patients (23%) remained in the study > 6 months. All nine evaluable during-treatment biopsies had reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK relative to pretreatment biopsies (average decrease ± standard deviation, 47% ± 24%). Mutational analysis revealed that the patient achieving a complete response and two of three evaluable patients achieving a partial response had PIK3CA mutations. Neither PTEN loss nor microsatellite instability correlated with efficacy. Responses to dabrafenib plus trametinib were comparable in patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice and the biopsied lesions from each corresponding patient. The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has activity in a subset of patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was inhibited in all patients evaluated, but to a lesser degree than observed in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib alone. PIK3CA mutations were identified in responding patients and thus do not preclude response to this regimen. Additional studies targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in this disease are warranted.,,;;Neuroendocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a broad spectrum of clinical behavior. Poorly differentiated tumors follow an aggressive course with limited treatment options, and new approaches are needed. Oncogenic BRAF V600E (BRAF(V600E)) substitutions are observed primarily in melanoma, colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, but have been identified in multiple tumor types. Here, we describe the first reported recurrent BRAF(V600E) mutations in advanced high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and identify a BRAF alteration frequency of 9% in 108 cases. Among these BRAF alterations, 80% were BRAF(V600E) Dramatic response to BRAF-MEK combination therapy occurred in two cases of metastatic high-grade rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma refractory to standard therapy. Urinary BRAF(V600E) circulating tumor DNA monitoring paralleled disease response. Our series represents the largest study of genomic profiling in colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and provides strong evidence that BRAF(V600E) is an oncogenic driver responsive to BRAF-MEK combination therapy in this molecular subset. BRAF(V600E) is an established oncogenic driver, but significant disparities in response exist among tumor types. Two patients with treatment-refractory high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors harboring BRAF(V600E) exhibited rapid and durable response to combined BRAF-MEK inhibition, providing the first clinical evidence of efficacy in this aggressive tumor type. Cancer Discov; 6(6); 594-600. ©2016 AACR.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 561.;;BRAF mutations act as an oncogenic driver via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BRAF inhibition has shown antitumour activity in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC. Dual MAPK pathway inhibition with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC might improve efficacy over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy based on observations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma. We aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC. In this phase 2, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, we enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with pretreated metastatic stage IV BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC who had documented tumour progression after at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy and had had no more than three previous systemic anticancer therapies. Patients with previous BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment were ineligible. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enrol only if the lesions were asymptomatic, untreated (or stable more than 3 weeks after local therapy if treated), and measured less than 1 cm. Enrolled patients received oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) in continuous 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, which was assessed by intention to treat in the protocol-defined population (patients who received second-line or later treatment); safety was also assessed in this population and was assessed at least once every 3 weeks, with adverse events, laboratory values, and vital signs graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634. Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 14, 2015, 59 patients from 30 centres in nine countries across North America, Europe, and Asia met eligibility criteria. Two patients who had previously been untreated due to protocol deviation were excluded; thus, 57 eligible patients were enrolled. 36 patients (63·2% [95% CI 49·3-75·6]) achieved an investigator-assessed overall response. Serious adverse events were reported in 32 (56%) of 57 patients and included pyrexia in nine (16%), anaemia in three (5%), confusional state in two (4%), decreased appetite in two (4%), haemoptysis in two (4%), hypercalcaemia in two (4%), nausea in two (4%), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in two (4%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia in five patients (9%), hyponatraemia in four (7%), and anaemia in three (5%). Four patients died during the study from fatal adverse events judged to be unrelated to treatment (one retroperitoneal haemorrhage, one subarachnoid haemorrhage, one respiratory distress, and one from disease progression that was more severe than typical progression, as assessed by the investigator). Dabrafenib plus trametinib could represent a new targeted therapy with robust antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.	Zou HY. et al.,Cancer Res.,2007

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Among these cancers are chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and atypical (BCR-ABL1-negative) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), both of which are diagnosed on the basis of neoplastic expansion of granulocytic cells and exclusion of genetic drivers that are known to occur in other myeloproliferative neoplasms and myeloproliferative-myelodysplastic overlap neoplasms. To identify potential genetic drivers in these disorders, we used an integrated approach of deep sequencing coupled with the screening of primary leukemia cells obtained from patients with CNL or atypical CML against panels of tyrosine kinase-specific small interfering RNAs or small-molecule kinase inhibitors. We validated candidate oncogenes using in vitro transformation assays, and drug sensitivities were validated with the use of assays of primary-cell colonies. We identified activating mutations in the gene encoding the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3R) in 16 of 27 patients (59%) with CNL or atypical CML. These mutations segregate within two distinct regions of CSF3R and lead to preferential downstream kinase signaling through SRC family-TNK2 or JAK kinases and differential sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. A patient with CNL carrying a JAK-activating CSF3R mutation had marked clinical improvement after the administration of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Mutations in CSF3R are common in patients with CNL or atypical CML and represent a potentially useful criterion for diagnosing these neoplasms.

Toward this objective, we have targeted MYC transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to RNA polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, we identify BET bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of JQ1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for BET bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.,,Bromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, particularly for hematologic malignancies. To date, however, genomic biomarkers to direct clinical translation have been lacking. We conducted a cell-based screen of genetically defined cancer cell lines using a prototypical inhibitor of BET bromodomains. Integration of genetic features with chemosensitivity data revealed a robust correlation between MYCN amplification and sensitivity to bromodomain inhibition. We characterized the mechanistic and translational significance of this finding in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with frequent amplification of MYCN. Genome-wide expression analysis showed downregulation of the MYCN transcriptional program accompanied by suppression of MYCN transcription. Functionally, bromodomain-mediated inhibition of MYCN impaired growth and induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma. BRD4 knockdown phenocopied these effects, establishing BET bromodomains as transcriptional regulators of MYCN. BET inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage in 3 in vivo neuroblastoma models, providing a compelling rationale for developing BET bromodomain inhibitors in patients with neuroblastoma.;;The MYC oncoproteins are thought to stimulate tumor cell growth and proliferation through amplification of gene transcription, a mechanism that has thwarted most efforts to inhibit MYC function as potential cancer therapy. Using a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to disrupt the transcription of amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate downregulation of the oncoprotein with consequent massive suppression of MYCN-driven global transcriptional amplification. This response translated to significant tumor regression in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma, without the introduction of systemic toxicity. The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma. These results indicate that CDK7 inhibition, by selectively targeting the mechanisms that promote global transcriptional amplification in tumor cells, may be useful therapy for cancers that are driven by MYC family oncoproteins.;;PIM1 kinase is coexpressed with c-MYC in human prostate cancers (PCs) and dramatically enhances c-MYC-induced tumorigenicity. Here we examine the effects of a novel oral PIM inhibitor, AZD1208, on prostate tumorigenesis and recurrence. A mouse c-MYC/Pim1-transduced tissue recombination PC model, Myc-CaP allografts, and human PC xenografts were treated with AZD1208 (n = 5-11 per group). Androgen-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) models were studied as well as the effects of hypoxia and radiation. RNA sequencing was used to analyze drug-induced gene expression changes. Results were analyzed with χ(2) test. Student's t test and nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum U Test. All statistical tests were two-sided. AZD1208 inhibited tumorigenesis in tissue recombinants, Myc-CaP, and human PC xenograft models. PIM inhibition decreased c-MYC/Pim1 graft growth by 54.3 ± 39% (P < .001), decreased cellular proliferation by 46 ± 14% (P = .016), and increased apoptosis by 326 ± 170% (P = .039). AZD1208 suppressed multiple protumorigenic pathways, including the MYC gene program. However, it also downregulated the p53 pathway. Hypoxia and radiation induced PIM1 in prostate cancer cells, and AZD1208 functioned as a radiation sensitizer. Recurrent tumors postcastration responded transiently to either AZD1208 or radiation treatment, and combination treatment resulted in more sustained inhibition of tumor growth. Cell lines established from recurrent, AZD1208-resistant tumors again revealed downregulation of the p53 pathway. Irradiated AZD1208-treated tumors robustly upregulated p53, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the effectiveness of combination therapy. Finally, an AZD1208-resistant gene signature was found to be associated with biochemical recurrence in PC patients. PIM inhibition is a potential treatment for MYC-driven prostate cancers including CRPC, and its effectiveness may be enhanced by activators of the p53 pathway, such as radiation.;;Amplification of the MYCN oncogene predicts treatment resistance in childhood neuroblastoma. We used a MYC target gene signature that predicts poor neuroblastoma prognosis to identify the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) as a crucial mediator of the MYC signal and a therapeutic target in the disease. FACT and MYCN expression created a forward feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells that was essential for maintaining mutual high expression. FACT inhibition by the small-molecule curaxin compound CBL0137 markedly reduced tumor initiation and progression in vivo. CBL0137 exhibited strong synergy with standard chemotherapy by blocking repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxic drugs, thus creating a synthetic lethal environment in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells and suggesting a treatment strategy for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. ;;Systematic studies of cancer genomes have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular nature of cancer. Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations.

High STAT3 levels have been reported in approximately 50% of patients with Ewing sarcoma, and may be important in tumorigenesis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits STAT3 activation. To date, while somatic mutations in PTPRD have been reported in diverse tumors, germline mutations of PTPRD have not been investigated in Ewing sarcoma or other cancers. We identified a novel germline mutation in the PTPRD gene in three of eight patients (37.5%) with metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Although the functional impact in two of the patients is unclear, in one of them the aberration was annotated as a W775stop germline mutation, and would be expected to lead to gene truncation and, hence, loss of the STAT3 dephosphorylation function of PTPRD. Since STAT3 is phosphorylated after being recruited to the insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), suppression of IGF-1R could attenuate the enhanced STAT3 activation expected in the presence of PTPRD mutations. Of interest, two of three patients with germline PTPRD mutations achieved durable complete responses following treatment with IGF-1R monoclonal antibody-based therapies.

Following the identification of HER2-activating events in the most recent lung carcinoma and in circulating tumor cells, we treated the reminiscent metastatic lesions with a lapatinib-based therapy. A symptomatic and radiologic clinical response was achieved. HER2V659E sensitivity to lapatinib was confirmed in the laboratory. The precise knowledge of the genomic alterations present in tumors is critical to selecting the optimal treatment for each patient. Here, we report the molecular characterization and clinical response to a lapatinib-based therapy for the tumors of a Li-Fraumeni patient showing prevalence of HER2 and EGFR genomic alterations.	;;Serra V. et al.,Cancer Discov,2013

We evaluated whether dovitinib (TKI258), an inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, presented antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancers. Preclinical activity of dovitinib was evaluated in both breast cancer cell lines and an FGFR1-amplified xenograft model (HBCx2). Dovitinib was then evaluated in a phase II trial that included 4 groups of patients with human EGF receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer on the basis of FGFR1 amplification and hormone receptor (HR) status. FGFR1 amplification was assessed by silver in situ hybridization. Preplanned retrospective analyses assessed predictive value of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGF3 amplifications by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Dovitinib monotherapy inhibits proliferation in FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified, but not FGFR-normal, breast cancer cell lines. Dovitinib also inhibits tumor growth in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer xenografts. Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the trial. Unconfirmed response or stable disease for more than 6 months was observed in 5 (25%) and 1 (3%) patient(s) with FGFR1-amplified/HR-positive and FGFR1-nonamplified/HR-positive breast cancer. When qPCR-identified amplifications in FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3 were grouped to define an FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer in HR-positive patients, the mean reduction in target lesions was 21.1% compared with a 12.0% increase in patients who did not present with FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer. Dovitinib showed antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancer cell lines and may have activity in breast cancers with FGF pathway amplification.;;Lucitanib is a potent, oral inhibitor fibroblast growth factor receptor types 1 and 2 (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor types 1, 2, and 3 (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor types α and β (PGFRα/β), which are essential kinases for tumor growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors. This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive). Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t½ was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients. Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.	André F. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013;;Soria JC. et al.,Ann. Oncol.,2014

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.,,Test the hypothesis that in BRAF-mutated melanomas, clinical responses to selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, will be restricted to tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. We conducted a phase II trial in patients with melanoma whose tumors harbored a BRAF mutation. Patients were stratified by phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low) and treated with selumetinib 75 mg per os twice daily. Pretreatment tumors were also analyzed for genetic changes in 230 genes of interest using an exon-capture approach. The high pAKT cohort was closed after no responses were seen in the first 10 patients. The incidence of low pAKT melanoma tumors was low (∼25% of melanomas tested) and this cohort was eventually closed because of poor accrual. However, among the five patients with melanoma accrued in the low pAKT cohort, there was one partial response (PR). Two other patients had near PRs before undergoing surgical resection of residual disease (one patient) or discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity (one patient). Among the two nonresponding, low pAKT patients with melanoma, co-mutations in MAP2K1, NF1, and/or EGFR were detected. Tumor regression was seen in three of five patients with BRAF-mutated, low pAKT melanomas; no responses were seen in the high pAKT cohort. These results provide rationale for co-targeting MEK and PI3K/AKT in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma whose tumors express high pAKT. However, the complexity of genetic changes in melanoma indicates that additional genetic information will be needed for optimal selection of patients likely to respond to MEK inhibitors.,,A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to targeted anticancer agents should speed the development of treatment strategies with lasting clinical efficacy. RAF inhibition in BRAF-mutant melanoma exemplifies the promise and challenge of many targeted drugs; although response rates are high, resistance invariably develops. Here, we articulate overarching principles of resistance to kinase inhibitors, as well as a translational approach to characterize resistance in the clinical setting through tumor mutation profiling. As a proof of principle, we performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 138 cancer genes in a tumor obtained from a patient with melanoma who developed resistance to PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response. The resulting profile identified an activating mutation at codon 121 in the downstream kinase MEK1 that was absent in the corresponding pretreatment tumor. The MEK1(C121S) mutation was shown to increase kinase activity and confer robust resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition in vitro. Thus, MEK1(C121S) or functionally similar mutations are predicted to confer resistance to combined MEK/RAF inhibition. These results provide an instructive framework for assessing mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition and illustrate the use of emerging technologies in a manner that may accelerate personalized cancer medicine.;;Many clinical cases of acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib have recently been reported. One of the causes of this acquired resistance is the BRAF downstream kinase point mutation MEK1-C121S. This mutation confers resistance to not only vemurafenib, but also to the allosteric MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). Here, we investigated the pharmacologic activities and effectiveness of the novel MEK inhibitor E6201 against BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1)-V600E mutant melanoma harboring the MEK1-C121S mutation. A cell-free assay confirmed that E6201 is an ATP-competitive MEK inhibitor, meaning it has a different binding mode with MEK compared with allosteric MEK inhibitors. E6201 is more effective against BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma compared with BRAF wild-type melanoma based on MEK inhibition. We found that the acquired MEK1-C121S mutation in BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma conferred resistance to both vemurafenib and selumetinib but not E6201. The effectiveness of E6201 in this preclinical study is a result of its binding with MEK1 far from the C121S point mutation so the mutation is unable to influence the MAPK pathway inhibitory activity. These results support further clinical investigation of E6201.	Emery CM. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009,,Catalanotti F. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013,,Wagle N. et al.,J. Clin.

Somatic activating MEK1 mutations are thought to be rare in melanomas, but their potential concurrence with V600E/KBRAF may be selected for by BRAFi. We sequenced MEK1/2 exon 3 in melanomas at baseline and upon disease progression. Of 31 baseline V600E/KBRAF melanomas, 5 (16%) carried concurrent somatic BRAF/MEK1 activating mutations. Three of 5 patients with BRAF/MEK1 double-mutant baseline melanomas showed objective tumor responses, consistent with the overall 60% frequency. No MEK1 mutation was found in disease progression melanomas, except when it was already identified at baseline. MEK1-mutant expression in V600E/KBRAF melanoma cell lines resulted in no significant alterations in p-ERK1/2 levels or growth-inhibitory sensitivities to BRAFi, MEK1/2 inhibitor (MEKi), or their combination. Thus, activating MEK1 exon 3 mutations identified herein and concurrent with V600E/KBRAF do not cause BRAFi resistance in melanoma. As BRAF inhibitors gain widespread use for treatment of advanced melanoma, biomarkers for drug sensitivity or resistance are urgently needed. We identify here concurrent activating mutations in BRAF and MEK1 in melanomas and show that the presence of a downstream mutation in MEK1 does not necessarily make BRAF–mutant melanomas resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.;;Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification.

Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.,,We assessed somatic alleles of six receptor tyrosine kinase genes mutated in lung adenocarcinoma for oncogenic activity. Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.	Zou HY. et al.,Cancer Res.,2007

These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.	Smalley KS. et al.,Oncogene,2009

Expression of EphA2 is increased in NSCLC metastases. In this study, we investigated EphA2 mutations in NSCLC and examined molecular pathways involved in NSCLC. Tumor and cell line DNA was sequenced. One EphA2 mutation was modeled by expression in BEAS2B cells, and functional and biochemical studies were conducted. A G391R mutation was detected in H2170 and 2/28 squamous cell carcinoma patient samples. EphA2 G391R caused constitutive activation of EphA2 with increased phosphorylation of Src, cortactin, and p130(Cas). Wild-type (WT) and G391R cells had 20 and 40% increased invasiveness; this was attenuated with knockdown of Src, cortactin, or p130(Cas). WT and G391R cells demonstrated a 70% increase in focal adhesion area. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation was increased in G391R cells with increased survival (55%) compared with WT (30%) and had increased sensitivity to rapamycin. A recurrent EphA2 mutation is present in lung squamous cell carcinoma and increases tumor invasion and survival through activation of focal adhesions and actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins as well as mTOR. Further study of EphA2 as a therapeutic target is warranted.	Faoro L. et al.,J. Biol. Chem.,2010;;Faoro L. et al.,J. Biol. Chem.,2010;;Faoro L. et al.,J. Biol. Chem.,2010;;Faoro L. et al.,J. Biol.

A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring an LMNA-NTRK1 rearrangement displayed a remarkable response to treatment with entrectinib, which was followed by the emergence of resistance. To characterize the molecular bases of the patient's relapse, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was collected longitudinally during treatment, and a tissue biopsy, obtained before entrectinib treatment, was transplanted in mice (xenopatient), which then received the same entrectinib regimen until resistance developed. Genetic profiling of ctDNA and xenopatient samples showed acquisition of two point mutations in the catalytic domain of NTRK1, p.G595R and p.G667C. Biochemical and pharmacologic analysis in multiple preclinical models confirmed that either mutation renders the TRKA kinase insensitive to entrectinib. These findings can be immediately exploited to design next-generation TRKA inhibitors. We provide proof of principle that analyses of xenopatients (avatar) and liquid biopsies allow the identification of drug resistance mechanisms in parallel with clinical treatment of an individual patient. We describe for the first time that p.G595R and p.G667C TRKA mutations drive acquired resistance to entrectinib in colorectal cancers carrying NTRK1 rearrangements.;;Larotrectinib, a selective TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated histology-agnostic efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers. Although responses to TRK inhibition can be dramatic and durable, duration of response may eventually be limited by acquired resistance. LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs. Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments. This approach led to rapid tumor responses and extended the overall duration of disease control achieved with TRK inhibition in both patients.Significance: LOXO-195 abrogated resistance in TRK fusion-positive cancers that acquired kinase domain mutations, a shared liability with all existing TRK TKIs. This establishes a role for sequential treatment by demonstrating continued TRK dependence and validates a paradigm for the accelerated development of next-generation inhibitors against validated oncogenic targets.

Sanger sequencing of the tyrosine kinome identified mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene in 3.8% of squamous cell lung cancers and cell lines. Squamous lung cancer cell lines harboring DDR2 mutations were selectively killed by knock-down of DDR2 by RNAi or by treatment with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Tumors established from a DDR2 mutant cell line were sensitive to dasatinib in xenograft models. Expression of mutated DDR2 led to cellular transformation which was blocked by dasatinib. A squamous cell lung cancer patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation. These data suggest that gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 are important oncogenic events and are amenable to therapy with dasatinib. As dasatinib is already approved for use, these findings could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. DDR2 mutations are present in 4% of lung SCCs, and DDR2 mutations are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. These findings provide a rationale for designing clinical trials with the FDA-approved drug dasatinib in patients with lung SCCs.	Hammerman PS. et al.,Cancer Discov,2011

Activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene cause hereditary MTC, which provides a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting RET kinase activity. This open-label, phase II study assessed the efficacy of vandetanib, a selective oral inhibitor of RET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, in patients with advanced hereditary MTC. METHODS Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hereditary MTC received initial treatment with once-daily oral vandetanib 300 mg. The dose was adjusted additionally in some patients on the basis of observed toxicity until disease progression or any other withdrawal criterion was met. The primary assessment was objective tumor response (by RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors]). Results Thirty patients received initial treatment with vandetanib 300 mg/d. On the basis of investigator assessments, 20% of patients (ie, six of 30 patients) experienced a confirmed partial response (median duration of response at data cutoff, 10.2 months). An additional 53% of patients (ie, 16 of 30 patients) experienced stable disease at >/= 24 weeks, which yielded a disease control rate of 73% (ie, 22 of 30 patients). In 24 patients, serum calcitonin levels showed a 50% or greater decrease from baseline that was maintained for at least 4 weeks; 16 patients showed a similar reduction in serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (70%), rash (67%), fatigue (63%), and nausea (63%). CONCLUSION In this study, vandetanib demonstrated durable objective partial responses and disease control with a manageable adverse event profile. These results demonstrate that vandetanib may provide an effective therapeutic option in patients with advanced hereditary MTC, a rare disease for which there has been no effective therapy.,,There is no effective therapy for patients with advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Vandetanib, a once-daily oral inhibitor of RET kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, has previously shown antitumor activity in a phase II study of patients with advanced hereditary MTC. Patients with advanced MTC were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive vandetanib 300 mg/d or placebo. On objective disease progression, patients could elect to receive open-label vandetanib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), determined by independent central Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessments. Between December 2006 and November 2007, 331 patients (mean age, 52 years; 90% sporadic; 95% metastatic) were randomly assigned to receive vandetanib (231) or placebo (100). At data cutoff (July 2009; median follow-up, 24 months), 37% of patients had progressed and 15% had died. The study met its primary objective of PFS prolongation with vandetanib versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69; P < .001). Statistically significant advantages for vandetanib were also seen for objective response rate (P < .001), disease control rate (P = .001), and biochemical response (P < .001). Overall survival data were immature at data cutoff (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.65). A final survival analysis will take place when 50% of the patients have died. Common adverse events (any grade) occurred more frequently with vandetanib compared with placebo, including diarrhea (56% v 26%), rash (45% v 11%), nausea (33% v 16%), hypertension (32% v 5%), and headache (26% v 9%). Vandetanib demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a phase III trial of patients with advanced MTC (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00410761).;;Medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma (MTC and PTC) are two types of thyroid cancer that can originate from activating mutations or rearrangements in the RET gene. Therapeutic options are limited in recurrent disease, but because RET is a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor involved in cellular growth and proliferation, treatment with a TK inhibitor might be promising. Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations. We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement. The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined. XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation. There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro. No TK inhibitor was superior for all the cell lines tested, indicating that mutation-specific therapies could be beneficial in treating MTC and PTC.;;Medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma (MTC and PTC) are two types of thyroid cancer that can originate from activating mutations or rearrangements in the RET gene.

The KIF5B-RET fusion leads to aberrant activation of RET kinase and is considered to be a new driver mutation of LADC because it segregates from mutations or fusions in EGFR, KRAS, HER2 and ALK, and a RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, suppresses the fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth activity of NIH3T3 cells.,,Applying a next-generation sequencing assay targeting 145 cancer-relevant genes in 40 colorectal cancer and 24 non-small cell lung cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens identified at least one clinically relevant genomic alteration in 59% of the samples and revealed two gene fusions, C2orf44-ALK in a colorectal cancer sample and KIF5B-RET in a lung adenocarcinoma. Further screening of 561 lung adenocarcinomas identified 11 additional tumors with KIF5B-RET gene fusions (2.0%; 95% CI 0.8-3.1%). Cells expressing oncogenic KIF5B-RET are sensitive to multi-kinase inhibitors that inhibit RET.;;Persistent RET activation is a frequent event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.;;;;Purpose In addition to prospective trials for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that are driven by less common genomic alterations, registries provide complementary information on patient response to targeted therapies. Here, we present the results of an international registry of patients with RET-rearranged NSCLCs, providing the largest data set, to our knowledge, on outcomes of RET-directed therapy thus far. Methods A global, multicenter network of thoracic oncologists identified patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC that harbored a RET rearrangement. Molecular profiling was performed locally by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or next-generation sequencing. Anonymized data-clinical, pathologic, and molecular features-were collected centrally and analyzed by an independent statistician. Best response to RET tyrosine kinase inhibition administered outside of a clinical trial was determined by RECIST v1.1. Results By April 2016, 165 patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC from 29 centers across Europe, Asia, and the United States were accrued. Median age was 61 years (range, 29 to 89 years). The majority of patients were never smokers (63%) with lung adenocarcinomas (98%) and advanced disease (91%). The most frequent rearrangement was KIF5B-RET (72%). Of those patients, 53 received one or more RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors in sequence: cabozantinib (21 patients), vandetanib (11 patients), sunitinib (10 patients), sorafenib (two patients), alectinib (two patients), lenvatinib (two patients), nintedanib (two patients), ponatinib (two patients), and regorafenib (one patient). The rate of any complete or partial response to cabozantinib, vandetanib, and sunitinib was 37%, 18%, and 22%, respectively. Further responses were observed with lenvantinib and nintedanib. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 5.0 months), and median overall survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.9 to 14.3 months).

However, the landscape of MET-specific targeting agents remains underdeveloped, and understanding of mechanisms of resistance to MET TKIs is limited. Here, we present a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring both a mutation in EGFR and an amplification of MET, who after progression on erlotinib responded dramatically to combined MET and EGFR inhibition with savolitinib and osimertinib. When resistance developed to this combination, a new MET kinase domain mutation, D1228V, was detected. Our in vitro findings demonstrate that METD1228V induces resistance to type I MET TKIs through impaired drug binding, while sensitivity to type II MET TKIs is maintained. Based on these findings, the patient was treated with erlotinib combined with cabozantinib, a type II MET inhibitor, and exhibited a response. With several structurally distinct MET inhibitors undergoing development for treatment of NSCLC, it is critical to identify mechanism-based therapies for drug resistance. We demonstrate that an acquired METD1228V mutation mediates resistance to type I, but not type II, MET inhibitors, having therapeutic implications for the clinical use of sequential MET inhibitors.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations.	Iorio F. et al.,Cell,2016

A comprehensive analysis of his tumor revealed a previously undescribed, kinase-inactivating BRAF mutation ((Y472C)BRAF); no inactivating BRAF mutations were found in the nonresponding tumors taken from other patients. Cells transfected with (Y472C)BRAF exhibited CRAF, MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation-characteristics identical to signaling changes that occur with previously known kinase-inactivating BRAF mutants. Dasatinib selectively induced senescence in NSCLC cells with inactivating BRAF mutations. Transfection of other NSCLC cells with these BRAF mutations also increased these cells' dasatinib sensitivity, whereas transfection with an activating BRAF mutation led to their increased dasatinib resistance. The sensitivity induced by (Y472C)BRAF was reversed by the introduction of a BRAF mutation that impairs RAF dimerization. Dasatinib inhibited CRAF modestly, but concurrently induced RAF dimerization, resulting in ERK activation in NSCLC cells with kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations. The sensitivity of NSCLC with kinase-impaired BRAF to dasatinib suggested synthetic lethality of BRAF and an unknown dasatinib target. Inhibiting BRAF in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type BRAF likewise enhanced these cells' dasatinib sensitivity. Thus, the patient's BRAF mutation was likely responsible for his tumor's marked response to dasatinib, suggesting that tumors bearing kinase-impaired BRAF mutations may be exquisitely sensitive to dasatinib. Moreover, the potential synthetic lethality of combination therapy including dasatinib and BRAF inhibitors may lead to additional therapeutic options against cancers with wild-type BRAF.

We uncovered that the activation of particular (proto-onco)genes is mediated by promoter hypomethylation. In search for therapeutic agents capable of targeting these potential cancer-promoting genes, we applied connectivity mapping on a gene expression signature based on the genes most significantly hypomethylated in t(4;11)-positive infant ALL as compared with healthy bone marrows. This analysis revealed histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as suitable candidates to reverse the unfavorable gene signature. We show that HDAC inhibitors effectively induce leukemic cell death in t(4;11)-positive primary infant ALL cells, accompanied by downregulation of MYC, SET, RUNX1, RAN as well as the MLL-AF4 fusion product. Furthermore, DNA methylation was restored after HDAC inhibitor exposure. Our data underlines the essential role for epigenetic de-regulation in MLL-rearranged ALL. Furthermore, we show, for the first time, that connectivity mapping can indirectly be applied on DNA methylation patterns, providing a rationale for HDAC inhibition in t(4;11)-positive leukemias. Given the presented potential of HDAC inhibitors to target important proto-oncogenes including the leukemia-specific MLL fusion in vitro, these agents should urgently be tested in in vivo models and subsequent clinical trials.;;,,,,Mislocated enzymatic activity of DOT1L has been proposed as a driver of leukemogenesis in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). The characterization of EPZ004777, a potent, selective inhibitor of DOT1L is reported. Treatment of MLL cells with the compound selectively inhibits H3K79 methylation and blocks expression of leukemogenic genes. Exposure of leukemic cells to EPZ004777 results in selective killing of those cells bearing the MLL gene translocation, with little effect on non-MLL-translocated cells. Finally, in vivo administration of EPZ004777 leads to extension of survival in a mouse MLL xenograft model. These results provide compelling support for DOT1L inhibition as a basis for targeted therapeutics against MLL.;;Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.;;Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to presentation and clinical outcome. The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML. We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients. We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.

Whole-exome sequencing of a patient with a 14-month complete response on this trial revealed two concurrent mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus. In vitro experiments demonstrate that both mutations are activating, suggesting a biologic mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus in this patient.

In lung SCC, one of the most frequently altered receptor tyrosine kinase families is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, with amplification or mutation observed in all four family members. Here, we describe the oncogenic nature of mutations observed in FGFR2 and FGFR3, each of which are observed in 3% of samples, for a mutation rate of 6% across both genes. Using cell culture and xenograft models, we show that several of these mutations drive cellular transformation. Transformation can be reversed by small-molecule FGFR inhibitors currently being developed for clinical use. We also show that mutations in the extracellular domains of FGFR2 lead to constitutive FGFR dimerization. In addition, we report a patient with an FGFR2-mutated oral SCC who responded to the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. These findings provide new insights into driving oncogenic events in a subset of lung squamous cancers, and recommend future clinical studies with FGFR inhibitors in patients with lung and head and neck SCC.,,Somatic mutations in FGFR2 are present in 4% to 5% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Amplification and mutations in FGFR genes have been identified in patients with NSCLCs, and clinical trials are testing the efficacy of anti-FGFR therapies. FGFR2 and other FGFR kinase family gene alterations have been found in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, although mouse models of FGFR-driven lung cancers have not been reported. Here, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of NSCLC driven by a kinase domain mutation in FGFR2. Combined with p53 ablation, primary grade 3/4 adenocarcinoma was induced in the lung epithelial compartment exhibiting locally invasive and pleiotropic tendencies largely made up of multinucleated cells.

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation.

To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.,,We assessed somatic alleles of six receptor tyrosine kinase genes mutated in lung adenocarcinoma for oncogenic activity.

However, functional consequences of the JAK3 mutations in TMD patients remain undetermined. To further understand how JAK3 mutations are involved in the development and/or progression of leukaemia in Down syndrome, additional TMD patients and the DS-AMKL cell line MGS were screened for JAK3 mutations, and we examined whether each JAK3 mutation is an activating mutation. JAK3 mutations were not detected in 10 TMD samples that had not previously been studied. Together with our previous report we detected JAK3 mutations in one in 11 TMD patients. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time that a TMD patient-derived JAK3 mutation (JAK3(I87T)), as well as two novel JAK3 mutations (JAK3(Q501H) and JAK3(R657Q)) identified in an MGS cell line, were activating mutations. Treatment of MGS cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK3 mutants with JAK3 inhibitors significantly decreased their growth and viability. These results suggest that the JAK3 activating mutation is an early event during leukaemogenesis in Down syndrome, and they provide proof-of-principle evidence that JAK3 inhibitors would have therapeutic effects on TMD and DS-AMKL patients carrying activating JAK3 mutations.

PIK3R1 (p85α) mutations occur at a higher rate in endometrial cancer than in any other tumor lineage, and PIK3R2 (p85β), not previously demonstrated to be a cancer gene, is also frequently mutated. The dominant activation event in the PI3K pathway appears to be PTEN protein loss. However, in tumors with retained PTEN protein, PI3K pathway mutations phenocopy PTEN loss, resulting in pathway activation. KRAS mutations are common in endometrioid tumors activating independent events from PI3K pathway aberrations. Multiple PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 mutations demonstrate gain of function, including disruption of a novel mechanism of pathway regulation wherein p85α dimers bind and stabilize PTEN. Taken together, the PI3K pathway represents a critical driver of endometrial cancer pathogenesis and a novel therapeutic target.,,Members of the mammalian phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) family of proteins are critical regulators of various cellular process including cell survival, growth, proliferation, and motility. Oncogenic activating mutations in the p110alpha catalytic subunit of the heterodimeric p110/p85 PI3K enzyme are frequent in human cancers. Here we show the presence of frequent mutations in p85alpha in colon cancer, a majority of which occurs in the inter-Src homology-2 (iSH2) domain. These mutations uncouple and retain p85alpha's p110-stabilizing activity, while abrogating its p110-inhibitory activity. The p85alpha mutants promote cell survival, AKT activation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and oncogenesis in a p110-dependent manner.

Women with histologically-confirmed, measurable, persistent/recurrent EC following one or two prior regimens were eligible and treated with 1500 mg oral lapatinib daily until progression or severe toxicity. A 2-stage group sequential design was used to evaluate the regimen with 6 month PFS as the primary endpoint. The trial had a 10% type I error rate with 90% power. EGFR, HER2, pERK, and Ki67 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from hysterectomy specimens, pre-treatment biopsies, and post-treatment biopsies (when available). Exons 18-21 of EGFR were sequenced. Three patients of 30 evaluable had PFS ≥6 months, one had a partial response, seven had stable disease, 21 had progressive disease and one was indeterminate. Three mutations in EGFR were identified. Two of these, L688F and K754E, were not associated with response or PFS. However, a newly identified mutation in exon 18, E690K, occurred in the patient with a partial response and progression-free survival extending past six months. While lapatinib has limited activity in unselected cases, the identification of a previously unreported mutation in EGFR (E690K) with a response suggests that lapatinib may be beneficial in some cases of EC.

Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to explore the landscape of gene fusions in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We observed that individual breast cancers have a variety of expressed gene fusions. We identified two classes of recurrent gene rearrangements involving genes encoding microtubule-associated serine-threonine kinase (MAST) and members of the Notch family. Both MAST and Notch-family gene fusions have substantial phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cell lines harboring Notch gene rearrangements are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of Notch signaling, and overexpression of MAST1 or MAST2 gene fusions has a proliferative effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that recurrent gene rearrangements have key roles in subsets of carcinomas and suggest that transcriptome sequencing could identify individuals with rare, targetable gene fusions.;;To identify and characterize novel, activating mutations in Notch receptors in breast cancer and to determine response to the gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) PF-03084014. We used several computational approaches, including novel algorithms, to analyze next-generation sequencing data and related omic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer cohort. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were sequenced, and Notch-mutant models were treated with PF-03084014. Gene-expression and functional analyses were performed to study the mechanism of activation through mutation and inhibition by PF-03084014. We identified mutations within and upstream of the PEST domains of NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3 in the TCGA dataset. Mutations occurred via several genetic mechanisms and compromised the function of the PEST domain, a negative regulatory domain commonly mutated in other cancers. Focal amplifications of NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 were also observed, as were heterodimerization or extracellular domain mutations at lower incidence. Mutations and amplifications often activated the Notch pathway as evidenced by increased expression of canonical Notch target genes, and functional mutations were significantly enriched in the triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TNBC). PDX models were also identified that harbored PEST domain mutations, and these models were highly sensitive to PF-03084014. This work suggests that Notch-altered breast cancer constitutes a bona fide oncogenic driver segment with the most common alteration being PEST domain mutations present in multiple Notch receptors. Importantly, functional studies suggest that this newly identified class can be targeted with Notch inhibitors, including GSIs.	,,;;Robinson DR. et al.,Nat. Med.,2011;;Wang K. et al.,Clin.

Amplification of RICTOR occurs in 13% of lung cancers (1,016 cases) in The Cancer Genome Atlas and at a similar frequency in an independent cohort of 1,070 patients identified by genomic profiling. In the latter series, 11% of cases harbored RICTOR amplification as the only relevant genomic alteration. Its oncogenic roles were suggested by decreased lung cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo with RICTOR ablation, and the transforming capacity of RICTOR in a Ba/F3-cell system. The mTORC1/2 inhibitors were significantly more active against RICTOR-amplified lung cancer cells as compared with other agents targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Moreover, an association between RICTOR amplification and sensitivities to mTORC1/2 inhibitors was observed. The index patient has been treated with mTORC1/2 inhibitors that led to tumor stabilization for more than 18 months. RICTOR amplification may define a novel and unique molecular subset of patients with lung cancer who may benefit from treatment with mTORC1/2 inhibitors.	Cheng H. et al.,Cancer Discov,2015

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Here we describe a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein-Barr virus, which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins; and tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes provides a roadmap for patient stratification and trials of targeted therapies. ;;Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 programmed death-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody that restores T-cell immune activity. This phase II trial assessed the antitumor activity, dose-response relationship, and safety of nivolumab in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Patients with clear-cell mRCC previously treated with agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway were randomly assigned (blinded ratio of 1:1:1) to nivolumab 0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate the dose-response relationship as measured by progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 168 patients were randomly assigned to the nivolumab 0.3- (n = 60), 2- (n = 54), and 10-mg/kg (n = 54) cohorts. One hundred eighteen patients (70%) had received more than one prior systemic regimen. Median PFS was 2.7, 4.0, and 4.2 months, respectively (P = .9). Respective ORRs were 20%, 22%, and 20%. Median OS was 18.2 months (80% CI, 16.2 to 24.0 months), 25.5 months (80% CI, 19.8 to 28.8 months), and 24.7 months (80% CI, 15.3 to 26.0 months), respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse event (AE) was fatigue (24%, 22%, and 35%, respectively). Nineteen patients (11%) experienced grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs. Nivolumab demonstrated antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile across the three doses studied in mRCC. No dose-response relationship was detected as measured by PFS. These efficacy and safety results in mRCC support study in the phase III setting.;;	,,;;;;,Nature,2014;;Motzer RJ. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015;;

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently amplified, overexpressed, or mutated in glioblastomas, but only 10 to 20 percent of patients have a response to EGFR kinase inhibitors. The mechanism of responsiveness of glioblastomas to these inhibitors is unknown. We sequenced kinase domains in the EGFR and human EGFR type 2 (Her2/neu) genes and analyzed the expression of EGFR, EGFR deletion mutant variant III (EGFRvIII), and the tumor-suppressor protein PTEN in recurrent malignant gliomas from patients who had received EGFR kinase inhibitors. We determined the molecular correlates of clinical response, validated them in an independent data set, and identified effects of the molecular abnormalities in vitro. Of 49 patients with recurrent malignant glioma who were treated with EGFR kinase inhibitors, 9 had tumor shrinkage of at least 25 percent. Pretreatment tissue was available for molecular analysis from 26 patients, 7 of whom had had a response and 19 of whom had rapid progression during therapy. No mutations in EGFR or Her2/neu kinase domains were detected in the tumors. Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was significantly associated with a clinical response (P<0.001; odds ratio, 51; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 669). These findings were validated in 33 patients who received similar treatment for glioblastoma at a different institution (P=0.001; odds ratio, 40; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 468). In vitro, coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN sensitized glioblastoma cells to erlotinib.

EGFR expression and signaling during treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib were analyzed by Western blot and compared with pre-erlotinib/gefitinib-exposed tissue or unexposed controls. Tumors were also analyzed for EGFR mutations and for other genomic abnormalities by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Clinical data were used to associate molecular features with tumor sensitivity to erlotinib or gefitinib. Erlotinib and gefitinib did not markedly affect EGFR activity in vivo.

The value of testing KRAS mutation status, in addition to EGFR GCN, was also explored. FISH analysis of 87 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab was done, recording individual GCN per cell and using different samples per tumor. Performances of published cutoff points and different summaries of EGFR GCN distribution were assessed for response prediction. In our data set, two published cutoff points performed less well than in their training set, yielding positive predictive values and negative predictive values between 40.0% and 48.3% and between 81.0% and 86.5%, respectively. Among summaries of GCN distribution explored, mean and right-tailed distribution of GCN yielded the highest performances. A mean EGFR GCN > or = 2.83 provided an area under the curve of 0.71. Important heterogeneity of repeated measures of mean EGFR GCN was observed within tumors (intraclass correlation, 0.61; within-class SD, 0.40), leading to potential misclassifications of FISH status in 7 of 18 (38.8%) patients if a cutoff point were used. In multivariable analysis, EGFR GCN testing provided significant information independent of the KRAS status to predict response (P = 0.016) and overall survival (P = 0.005). We confirm the association between increased EGFR GCN and outcome after cetuximab. However, because of reproducibility concerns, any decision making based on published cutoff points is not warranted.,,In a previous cohort study, we proposed that responsiveness of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies has a genetic basis, being associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (GCN) as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in individual tumors. The present study was aimed at assessing the predictive role of EGFR GCN, in terms of clinical outcome, in patients treated with panitumumab. Patients with mCRC refractory to standard therapies were a subset of patients from a phase III trial of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC; n = 58) versus BSC alone (n = 34) who were selected on the basis of availability of tumor samples adequate for FISH. In patients treated with panitumumab, a mean EGFR GCN of less than 2.5/nucleus or less than 40% of tumor cells displaying chromosome 7 polysomy within the tumor predicted for shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P = .039 and P = .029, respectively) and overall survival (P = .015 and P = .014, respectively). None of the treated patients with mean EGFR GCN of less than 2.47/nucleus or less than 43% of tumor cells displaying chromosome 7 polysomy obtained objective response compared with six of 20 and six of 19 patients with values greater than these cutoff limits, respectively (P = .0009 and P = .0007, respectively). Evaluation of BSC-treated patients showed no correlation between EGFR GCN or chromosome 7 polysomy status and PFS. In a larger and more homogeneous series than in previous studies, present exploratory data suggest that mCRC patients with tumors distinguishable by FISH analysis of EGFR as homogenously disomic or with low chromosome 7 polysomy have a reduced likelihood of response to panitumumab.;;Approximately 50% of glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR gene amplification. In approximately 25% of instances, constitutively activated EGFR mutants are present. These observations make EGFR-inhibiting drugs a logical approach for trials in recurrent GBM. In a randomized, controlled, phase II trial, 110 patients with progressive GBM after prior radiotherapy were randomly assigned to either erlotinib or a control arm that received treatment with either temozolomide or carmustine (BCNU). The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Tumor specimens obtained at first surgery were investigated for EGFR expression; EGFRvIII mutants; EGFR amplification; EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21; and pAkt. These results were correlated with outcome. Pharmacokinetic analysis was part of the study. RESULTS; Treatment was well tolerated in general; skin toxicity was the most frequent adverse effect of erlotinib. The 6-month PFS rate in the erlotinib arm was 11.4% (95% CI, 4.6% to 21.5%), and it was 24% in the control arm. Of all explored biomarkers, only low pAkt expression appeared to be of borderline significance to an improved outcome. None of the eight patients who had tumors with EGFRvIII mutant presence and PTEN expression had 6-month PFS. The use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants significantly increased erlotinib clearance, but pharmacokinetic findings were not related to outcome. Erlotinib has insufficient single-agent activity in unselected GBM.

A prospective phase II clinical trial evaluating neoadjuvant gefitinib given prior to standard treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy. Patients with stable disease after one cycle received escalated doses. Patients who responded were given gefitinib during radiation therapy, as well as maintenance therapy after definitive treatment. We analyzed the correlation between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, mutation status, and gene copy number on available tissue samples and clinical response. Twenty-three patients were accrued and 22 patients were evaluable for response prior to definitive local treatment; complete responses were attained by 18.2% of patients and partial responses by 27.3%. Grades 2 to 3 toxicities were observed in 59.1% of patients experiencing class-specific effects during induction therapy. After induction, 11.8% underwent surgery alone, 17.6% had definitive radiation, 11.8% were treated with radiation and concurrent gefitinib, and 47% had surgery with postoperative radiation and concurrent gefitinib. Median follow-up for the censored observations was 32 months. Two-year overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival rates were 72.1%, 72.1%, and 63.6%, respectively. No EGFR-activating mutations were identified in tumor samples available from 10 patients. No associations between EGFR correlative studies and patient outcomes were identified. Gefitinib, in the neoadjuvant setting, was active and well tolerated in patients with aggressive CSCC and did not interfere with definitive treatment. In view of the 18% complete response rate we observed, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be further explored in the treatment of aggressive CSCC.;;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) somatic mutations defined a new, molecularly classified subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Classic EGFR activating mutations, such as inframe deletions in exon 19 or the Leu858Arg (L858R) point mutation in exon 21 are associated with sensitivity to first generation quinazoline reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are typically located after the C-helix of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, may account for up to 4% of all EGFR mutations. Preclinical models have shown that the most prevalent EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated proteins are resistant to clinically achievable doses of reversible (gefitinib, erlotinib) and irreversible (neratinib, afatinib, PF00299804) EGFR TKIs. Growing clinical experience with patients whose tumours harbour EGFR exon 20 insertions corresponds with the preclinical data; very few patients have had responses to EGFR TKIs. Despite the prevalence and biological importance of EEGFR exon 20 insertions, few reports have summarised all preclinical and clinical data on these mutations. Here, we review the literature and provide an update with an emphasis on the structural, molecular, and clinical implications of EGFR exon 20 insertions.,,Exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 L858R mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) predict activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib; however, the ability of less common EGFR mutations to predict efficacy of erlotinib is unclear. The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.,,Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer tumours that have EGFR mutations have deletion mutations in exon 19 or the Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21, or both (ie, common mutations). However, a subset of patients (10%) with mutations in EGFR have tumours that harbour uncommon mutations. There is a paucity of data regarding the sensitivity of these tumours to EGFR inhibitors. Here we present data for the activity of afatinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer that have tumours harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations. In this post-hoc analysis, we used prospectively collected data from tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced (stage IIIb-IV) lung adenocarcinomas who were given afatinib in a single group phase 2 trial (LUX-Lung 2), and randomised phase 3 trials (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6). Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, including all randomly assigned patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The type of EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only; Asian vs non-Asian) were pre-specified stratification factors in the randomised trials. We categorised all uncommon mutations as: point mutations or duplications in exons 18-21 (group 1); de-novo Thr790Met mutations in exon 20 alone or in combination with other mutations (group 2); or exon 20 insertions (group 3). We also assessed outcomes in patients with the most frequent uncommon mutations, Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, alone or in combination with other mutations. Response was established by independent radiological review. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00525148, NCT00949650, and NCT01121393. Of 600 patients given afatinib across the three trials, 75 (12%) patients had uncommon EGFR mutations (38 in group 1, 14 in group 2, 23 in group 3). 27 (71·1%, 95% CI 54·1-84·6) patients in group 1 had objective responses, as did two (14·3%, 1·8-42·8) in group 2 and two (8·7%, 1·1-28·0) in group 3. Median progression-free survival was 10·7 months (95% CI 5·6-14·7) in group 1, 2·9 months (1·2-8·3) in group 2; and 2·7 months (1·8-4·2) in group 3. Median overall survival was 19·4 months (95% CI 16·4-26·9) in group 1, 14·9 months (8·1-24·9) in group 2, and 9·2 months (4·1-14·2) in group 3. For the most frequent uncommon mutations, 14 (77·8%, 95% CI 52·4-93·6) patients with Gly719Xaa had an objective response, as did nine (56·3%, 29·9-80·2) with Leu861Gln, and eight (100·0%, 63·1-100·0) with Ser768Ile. Afatinib was active in non-small-cell lung cancer tumours that harboured certain types of uncommon EGFR mutations, especially Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, but less active in other mutations types. Clinical benefit was lower in patients with de-novo Thr790Met and exon 20 insertion mutations. These data could help inform clinical decisions for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations. Boehringer Ingelheim.;;Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotyping is now standard in the management of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, as this biomarker predicts marked benefit from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). EGFR exon 19 insertions are a poorly described family of EGFR mutations, and their association with EGFR-TKI sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma is uncertain. Patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR exon 19 insertions were studied. The predicted effects of the insertions on the structure of the EGFR protein were examined, and EGFR exon 19 insertions were introduced into Ba/F3 cells to assess oncogenicity and in vitro sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. In patients receiving TKI, response magnitude was assessed with serial computed tomographic (CT) measurement. Twelve tumors harboring EGFR exon 19 insertions were identified; patients were predominately female (92%) and never-smokers (75%). The 11 specimens available for full sequencing all showed an 18-bp insertion that resulted in the substitution of a Pro for Leu at residue 747. The mutant EGFR transformed the Ba/F3 cells, which were then sensitive to EGFR-TKI. Six patients with measurable disease received TKI and five had a response on serial CT. EGFR exon 19 insertions are a newly appreciated family of EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutations, and patients with tumors harboring these mutations should be treated with EGFR-TKI. While these mutations may be missed through the use of some mutation-specific assays, the addition of PCR product size analysis to multigene assays allows sensitive detection of both exon 19 insertion and deletion mutations.;;This randomized, open-label trial compared dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/HER1, HER2, and HER4, with erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;This randomized, open-label trial compared dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/HER1, HER2, and HER4, with erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.,,We aimed to assess the effect of afatinib on overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma through an analysis of data from two open-label, randomised, phase 3 trials. Previously untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=345) and LUX-Lung 6 (n=364). These patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive afatinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 3] or gemcitabine-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 6]), stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only). We planned analyses of mature overall survival data in the intention-to-treat population after 209 (LUX-Lung 3) and 237 (LUX-Lung 6) deaths. These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00949650 and NCT01121393. Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 3 was 41 months (IQR 35-44); 213 (62%) of 345 patients had died. Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 6 was 33 months (IQR 31-37); 246 (68%) of 364 patients had died. In LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 28.2 months (95% CI 24.6-33.6) in the afatinib group and 28.2 months (20.7-33.2) in the pemetrexed-cisplatin group (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.17, p=0.39). In LUX-Lung 6, median overall survival was 23.1 months (95% CI 20.4-27.3) in the afatinib group and 23.5 months (18.0-25.6) in the gemcitabine-cisplatin group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.22, p=0.61). However, in preplanned analyses, overall survival was significantly longer for patients with del19-positive tumours in the afatinib group than in the chemotherapy group in both trials: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 33.3 months (95% CI 26.8-41.5) in the afatinib group versus 21.1 months (16.3-30.7) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.79, p=0.0015); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 31.4 months (95% CI 24.2-35.3) versus 18.4 months (14.6-25.6), respectively (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, p=0.023). By contrast, there were no significant differences by treatment group for patients with EGFR Leu858Arg-positive tumours in either trial: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 27.6 months (19.8-41.7) in the afatinib group versus 40.3 months (24.3-not estimable) in the chemotherapy group (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80-2.11, p=0.29); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 19.6 months (95% CI 17.0-22.1) versus 24.3 months (19.0-27.0), respectively (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.81-1.83, p=0.34). In both trials, the most common afatinib-related grade 3-4 adverse events were rash or acne (37 [16%] of 229 patients in LUX-Lung 3 and 35 [15%] of 239 patients in LUX-Lung 6), diarrhoea (33 [14%] and 13 [5%]), paronychia (26 [11%] in LUX-Lung 3 only), and stomatitis or mucositis (13 [5%] in LUX-Lung 6 only). In LUX-Lung 3, neutropenia (20 [18%] of 111 patients), fatigue (14 [13%]) and leucopenia (nine [8%]) were the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events, while in LUX-Lung 6, the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (30 [27%] of 113 patients), vomiting (22 [19%]), and leucopenia (17 [15%]). Although afatinib did not improve overall survival in the whole population of either trial, overall survival was improved with the drug for patients with del19 EGFR mutations. The absence of an effect in patients with Leu858Arg EGFR mutations suggests that EGFR del19-positive disease might be distinct from Leu858Arg-positive disease and that these subgroups should be analysed separately in future trials. Boehringer Ingelheim.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.;;Evidence is scarce for the effectiveness of therapies for oesophageal cancer progressing after chemotherapy, and no randomised trials have been reported. We aimed to compare gefitinib with placebo in previously treated advanced oesophageal cancer. For this phase 3, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, eligible patients were adults with advanced oesophageal cancer or type I/II Siewert junctional tumours, histologically confirmed squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, who had progressed after chemotherapy, with WHO performance status 0-2, and with measurable or evaluable disease on CT scan. Participants were recruited from 48 UK centres and randomly assigned (1:1) to gefitinib (500 mg) or matching placebo by simple randomisation with no stratification factors. Patients, clinicians, and trial office staff were masked to treatment allocation. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient choice. The primary outcome was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN29580179. Between March 30, 2009, and Nov 18, 2011, 450 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (one patient withdrew consent; 224 patients allocated gefitinib and 225 allocated placebo included in analyses). Overall survival did not differ between groups (median 3·73 months, 95% CI 3·23-4·50, for gefitinib vs 3·67 months, 95% CI 2·97-4·37, for placebo; hazard ratio [HR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·74-1·09, p=0·29). Among the prespecified patient-reported outcomes (110 patients on gefitinib and 121 on placebo completed both baseline and 4 week questionnaires and were included in analyses), odynophagia was significantly better in the gefitinib group (adjusted mean difference -8·61, 95% CI -14·49 to -2·73; n=227; p=0·004), whereas the other outcomes were not significantly improved compared with placebo: global quality of life (2·69, 95% CI -2·33 to 7·72, n=231, p=0·293), dysphagia (-3·18, 95% CI -8·36 to 2·00, n=231, p=0·228), and eating (-4·11, 95% CI -9·96 to 1·75, n=229, p=0·168). Median progression-free survival was marginally longer with gefitinib than it was with placebo (1·57 months, 95% CI 1·23-1·90 in the gefitinib group vs 1·17 months, 95% CI 1·07-1·37 in the placebo group; HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·66-0·96, p=0·020). The most common toxicities were diarrhoea (36 [16%] of 224 patients on gefitinib vs six [3%] of 225 on placebo) and skin toxicity (46 [21%] vs two [1%]), both mostly grade 2. The commonest grade 3-4 toxicities were fatigue (24 [11%] vs 13 [6%] patients) and diarrhoea (13 [6%] vs two [1%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 109 (49%) of 224 patients assigned to gefitinib and 101 (45%) of 225 on placebo. 54 (24%) of patients in the gefitinib group achieved disease control at 8 weeks, as did 35 (16%) of patients on placebo (p=0·023). The use of gefitinib as a second-line treatment in oesophageal cancer in unselected patients does not improve overall survival, but has palliative benefits in a subgroup of these difficult-to-treat patients with short life expectancy. Future research should focus on identification of predictive biomarkers to identify this subgroup of benefiting patients. Cancer Research UK.;;EGFR mutated lung cancer accounts for a significant subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Over the last decade, multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been developed to target mutated EGFR. However, there is little information regarding mutation specific potency of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations. The purpose of this study is to establish an in vitro model to determine the \"therapeutic window\" of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The potency of 1st (erlotinib), 2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express mutated or wild type EGFR. An in vitro model of mutation specificity was created by calculating the ratio of IC50 values between mutated and wild type EGFR. The in vitro model identified a wide therapeutic window of afatinib for exon 19 deletions and L858R and of osimertinib and rociletinib for T790M positive mutations. The results obtained with our models matched well with previously reported preclinical and clinical data. Interestingly, for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, most of which are known to be resistant to 1st and 2nd generation EGFR-TKIS, osimertinib was potent and presented a wide therapeutic window. To our knowledge, this is the first report that has identified the therapeutic window of osimertinib for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In conclusion, this model will provide a preclinical rationale for proper selection of EGFR-TKIs against clinically-relevant EGFR mutations. ;;The clinical impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not been described. We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of NGS in the routine care of patients with HNSCC and to correlate genomic alterations with clinical outcomes. Single-center study examining targeted NGS platform used to sequence tumor DNA obtained from 213 HNSCC patients evaluated in outpatient head and neck oncology clinic between August 2011 and December 2014. We correlated tumor genomic profiling results with clinical outcomes. PI3K/RTK pathway activation occurred frequently [activating PIK3CA mutation or amplification (13%), PTEN inactivation (3%), RAS activation (6%), EGFR or ERBB2 activation (9%)]. Alterations in pathways affecting cell-cycle regulation [CCND1 amplification (9%), CDKN2A inactivation (17%), BRCA2 inactivation (2%)] and squamous differentiation [NOTCH1 inactivation (8%) andEP300 inactivation (6%)] were identified. PIK3CA amplification (n = 43), not PIK3CA mutation, was associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0006). Oncogenic RAS mutations (n = 13) were associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0001) and lower overall survival (P = 0.003). Eight patients with advanced, treatment-refractory HNSCC enrolled on clinical trials matched to tumor profiling results, and 50% achieved a partial response. Incorporation of NGS clinical assays into the routine care of patients with HNSCC is feasible and may readily facilitate enrollment into clinical trials of targeted therapy with a higher likelihood of success. Data can be utilized for discovery of genomic biomarkers of outcome. PIK3CA amplification and RAS mutations were frequently identified and associated with poorer prognosis in this cohort.

The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.;;Exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 L858R mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) predict activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib; however, the ability of less common EGFR mutations to predict efficacy of erlotinib is unclear.

Little is known about cancers harboring these mutations aside from their lack of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, impairing the development of effective targeted therapies. NSCLC patients with EGFR genotyping were studied using a mechanism approved by the Institutional Review Board. Cancers with exon 20 insertions were indentified, sequences were characterized, and effectiveness of different treatment regimens was reviewed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared with cancers harboring common EGFR mutations and cancers with wild-type EGFR. One thousand eighty-six patients underwent EGFR genotyping from 2004 to 2012. Twenty seven (2.5%) harbored exon 20 insertions, making up 9.2% of all cancers with documented EGFR mutations. Compared with wild-type cancers, those with exon 20 insertions were more commonly found in never-smokers and Asian patients. Insertion sequences were highly variable, with the most common variant (V769_D770insASV) making up only 22% of cases. Median survival of patients with exon 20 insertions was 16 months, similar to the survival of wild-type cancers and shorter than the survival of cancers with common EGFR mutations. Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions have similar clinical characteristics to those with common EGFR mutations but a poorer prognosis. The prevalence of this subset of NSCLC is similar to that of other genotype-defined subsets of lung adenocarcinoma (e.g. those with BRAF mutations, HER2 insertions, ROS1 rearrangements) and is a population of interest for trials of new targeted therapies.;;Here, we report that novel epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene fusions comprising the N-terminal of EGFR linked to various fusion partners, most commonly RAD51, are recurrent in lung cancer. We describe five patients with metastatic lung cancer whose tumors harbored EGFR fusions, four of whom were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with documented antitumor responses. In vitro, EGFR-RAD51 fusions are oncogenic and can be therapeutically targeted with available EGFR TKIs and therapeutic antibodies. These results support the dependence of EGFR-rearranged tumors on EGFR-mediated signaling and suggest several therapeutic strategies for patients whose tumors harbor this novel alteration. We report for the first time the identification and therapeutic targeting of EGFR C-terminal fusions in patients with lung cancer and document responses to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in 4 patients whose tumors harbored EGFR fusions.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Point mutations of EZH2 at Tyr641 and Ala677 occur in subpopulations of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where they drive H3K27 hypertrimethylation. Here we report the discovery of EPZ005687, a potent inhibitor of EZH2 (K(i) of 24 nM). EPZ005687 has greater than 500-fold selectivity against 15 other protein methyltransferases and has 50-fold selectivity against the closely related enzyme EZH1. The compound reduces H3K27 methylation in various lymphoma cells; this translates into apoptotic cell killing in heterozygous Tyr641 or Ala677 mutant cells, with minimal effects on the proliferation of wild-type cells. These data suggest that genetic alteration of EZH2 (for example, mutations at Tyr641 or Ala677) results in a critical dependency on enzymatic activity for proliferation (that is, the equivalent of oncogene addiction), thus portending the clinical use of EZH2 inhibitors for cancers in which EZH2 is genetically altered.,,Mutations within the catalytic domain of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 have been identified in subsets of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). These genetic alterations are hypothesized to confer an oncogenic dependency on EZH2 enzymatic activity in these cancers. We have previously reported the discovery of EPZ005678 and EPZ-6438, potent and selective S-adenosyl-methionine-competitive small molecule inhibitors of EZH2. Although both compounds are similar with respect to their mechanism of action and selectivity, EPZ-6438 possesses superior potency and drug-like properties, including good oral bioavailability in animals. Here, we characterize the activity of EPZ-6438 in preclinical models of NHL. EPZ-6438 selectively inhibits intracellular lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) methylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in both EZH2 wild-type and mutant lymphoma cells. Inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3) leads to selective cell killing of human lymphoma cell lines bearing EZH2 catalytic domain point mutations. Treatment of EZH2-mutant NHL xenograft-bearing mice with EPZ-6438 causes dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, including complete and sustained tumor regressions with correlative diminution of H3K27Me3 levels in tumors and selected normal tissues. Mice dosed orally with EPZ-6438 for 28 days remained tumor free for up to 63 days after stopping compound treatment in two EZH2-mutant xenograft models. These data confirm the dependency of EZH2-mutant NHL on EZH2 activity and portend the utility of EPZ-6438 as a potential treatment for these genetically defined cancers.	Knutson SK. et al.,Nat. Chem.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml.

We retrospectively investigated the relevance of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations for pediatric T-ALL patients enrolled on Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL7/8 or ALL9 or the German Co-Operative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia study (COALL-97) protocols. NOTCH1-activating mutations were identified in 63% of patients. NOTCH1 mutations affected the heterodimerization, the juxtamembrane and/or the PEST domains, but not the RBP-J-κ-associated module, the ankyrin repeats or the transactivation domain. Reverse-phase protein microarray data confirmed that NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations resulted in increased intracellular NOTCH1 levels in primary T-ALL biopsies. Based on microarray expression analysis, NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations were associated with activation of NOTCH1 direct target genes including HES1, DTX1, NOTCH3, PTCRA but not cMYC. NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations were associated with TLX3 rearrangements, but were less frequently identified in TAL1- or LMO2-rearranged cases. NOTCH1-activating mutations were less frequently associated with mature T-cell developmental stage. Mutations were associated with a good initial in vivo prednisone response, but were not associated with a superior outcome in the DCOG and COALL cohorts. Comparing our data with other studies, we conclude that the prognostic significance for NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations is not consistent and may depend on the treatment protocol given.;;Microtubules have pivotal roles in fundamental cellular processes and are targets of antitubulin chemotherapeutics. Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas. These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms. The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear. Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.;;Microtubules have pivotal roles in fundamental cellular processes and are targets of antitubulin chemotherapeutics.

In this study, we explore whether FBXW7 plays any role in metastatic process. We show that depletion of FBXW7 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human colon cancer cells along with the increase in cell migration and invasion. Moreover, FBXW7 deficiency promotes the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells in tumor-sphere culture. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin suppresses FBXW7 loss-driven EMT, invasion and stemness. Our results define the FBXW7/mTOR axis as a novel EMT pathway that mediates cancer invasion.

It is response for a high mortality rate. Nowadays, few researches have been performed on sorafenib against OS and no tools are available to guide the use of sorafenib in the OS treatment. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of sorafenib on OS cell MG63 and figure the potential effective molecular pathway of its function. In the present study, we performed assays of cell proliferation, RT-PCR, and western blot to investigate the effect of sorafenib on OS MG63 cells and to elucidate the molecular actions of sorafenib against RTKs VEGFR2 and RET, as well as MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The present study confirmed that sorafenib could inhibit the proliferation of OS MG63 cells and caused a series of biomolecule effects, including the change of VEGFR2 and ERK gene expression, and the phosphorylation alteration of VEGFR2, RET, and MEK1 proteins. VEGFR2, RET, and MEK/ERK signaling pathway are involved in the pharmacological mechanism of sorafenib. They are potential candidate targets for OS treatment.	Palanisamy N. et al.,Nat.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

In this report, we describe a unique subset of EOC with alterations in another DNA repair pathway, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which may exhibit a discordance in sensitivities to these drugs. Specifically, 8% of high-grade serous EOC from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset exhibited NER alterations, including nonsynonymous or splice site mutations and homozygous deletions of NER genes. Tumors with NER alterations were associated with improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), compared with patients without NER alterations or BRCA1/2 mutations. Furthermore, patients with tumors with NER alterations had similar OS and PFS as BRCA1/2-mutated patients, suggesting that NER pathway inactivation in EOC conferred enhanced platinum sensitivity, similar to BRCA1/2-mutated tumors. Moreover, two NER mutations (ERCC6-Q524* and ERCC4-A583T), identified in the two most platinum-sensitive tumors, were functionally associated with platinum sensitivity in vitro. Importantly, neither NER alteration affected HR or conferred sensitivity to PARPi or other double-strand break-inducing agents. Overall, our findings reveal a new mechanism of platinum sensitivity in EOC that, unlike defective HR, may lead to a discordance in sensitivity to platinum and PARPi, with potential implications for previously reported and ongoing PARPi trials in this disease.

Enhanced responses to ruxolitinib were observed in samples harboring JAK-activating lesions and higher levels of STAT5 phosphorylation. Rapamycin controlled leukemia burden in all 8 B-ALL samples. Survival analysis of 2 representative B-ALL xenografts demonstrated prolonged survival with rapamycin treatment compared with vehicle (P < .01). These data demonstrate preclinical in vivo efficacy of ruxolitinib and rapamycin in this high-risk B-ALL subtype, for which novel treatments are urgently needed, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeted kinase inhibition in Ph-like ALL.

The current analysis aimed to identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment. Archival tumor samples from patients in BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 were analyzed using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Sanger sequencing. Biomarker data were available for 549 patients. PIK3CA activating mutations and PTEN loss were reported in 30% and 16% of BOLERO-1 samples and in 32% and 12% of BOLERO-3 samples, respectively. PI3K pathway was hyperactive (PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss and/or AKT1 mutation) in 47% of BOLERO-1 and 41% of BOLERO-3 samples. In both studies, differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently observed in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing combined data sets of both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased hazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.00), PTEN loss (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93). Patients with wild-type PIK3CA (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46), normal PTEN (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.26), or normal PI3K pathway activity (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.62) did not derive PFS benefit from everolimus. This analysis, although exploratory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer having tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or hyperactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus.

Patients with well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma were enrolled at four centres in France. Patients received up to three 28-day neoadjuvant treatment cycles of RG7112 1440 mg/m(2) per day for 10 days. If a patient progressed at any point after the first cycle, the lesion was resected or, if unresectable, an end-of-study biopsy was done. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis). All analyses were per protocol. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2009-015522-10. Between June 3, and Dec 14, 2010, 20 patients were enrolled and completed pretreatment and day 8 biopsies. 18 of 20 patients had TP53 wild-type tumours and two carried missense TP53 mutations. 14 of 17 assessed patients had MDM2 gene amplification. Compared with baseline, P53 and P21 concentrations, assessed by immunohistochemistry, had increased by a median of 4·86 times (IQR 4·38-7·97; p=0·0001) and 3·48 times (2·05-4·09; p=0·0001), respectively, at day 8 (give or take 2 days). At the same timepoint, relative MDM2 mRNA expression had increased by a median of 3·03 times (1·23-4·93; p=0·003) that at baseline. The median change from baseline for Ki-67-positive tumour cells was -5·05% (IQR -12·55 to 0·05; p=0·01). Drug exposure correlated with blood concentrations of MIC-1 (p<0·0001) and haematological toxicity. One patient had a confirmed partial response and 14 had stable disease. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, mostly nausea (14 patients), vomiting (11 patients), asthenia (nine patients), diarrhoea (nine patients), and thrombocytopenia (eight patients). There were 12 serious adverse events in eight patients, the most common of which were neutropenia (six patients) and thrombocytopenia (three patients). MDM2 inhibition activates the P53 pathway and decreases cell proliferation in MDM2-amplified liposarcoma. This study suggests that it is feasible to undertake neoadjuvant biopsy-driven biomarker studies in liposarcoma. F Hoffmann-La Roche.,,;;To identify novel therapeutic drug targets for p53-mutant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). RNAi kinome viability screens were performed on HNSCC cells, including autologous pairs from primary tumor and recurrent/metastatic lesions, and in parallel on murine squamous cell carcinoma (MSCC) cells derived from tumors of inbred mice bearing germline mutations in Trp53, and p53 regulatory genes: Atm, Prkdc, and p19(Arf). Cross-species analysis of cell lines stratified by p53 mutational status and metastatic phenotype was used to select 38 kinase targets. Both primary and secondary RNAi validation assays were performed on additional HNSCC cell lines to credential these kinase targets using multiple phenotypic endpoints. Kinase targets were also examined via chemical inhibition using a panel of kinase inhibitors. A preclinical study was conducted on the WEE1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775. Our functional kinomics approach identified novel survival kinases in HNSCC involved in G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint, SFK, PI3K, and FAK pathways. RNAi-mediated knockdown and chemical inhibition of the WEE1 kinase with a specific inhibitor, MK-1775, had a significant effect on both viability and apoptosis. Sensitivity to the MK-1775 kinase inhibitor is in part determined by p53 mutational status, and due to unscheduled mitotic entry. MK-1775 displays single-agent activity and potentiates the efficacy of cisplatin in a p53-mutant HNSCC xenograft model. WEE1 kinase is a potential therapeutic drug target for HNSCC. This study supports the application of a functional kinomics strategy to identify novel therapeutic targets for cancer.;;TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53). This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63 and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the ΔN isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive functions. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy, thus a clear understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the β cells of the pancreas. We found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers. ;;TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53).

A total of 225 patients were enrolled: 33 in dose escalation and 192 in tumor-specific cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was 200 mg every 12 hours. The most common possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events involved fatigue and the gastrointestinal, renal, or hematopoietic systems. Plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacodynamic effects were observed in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors. Radiographic responses were achieved in previously treated patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the overall response rate was 31%; moreover, 61% of patients achieved either response or stable disease lasting ≥6 months. Abemaciclib represents the first selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 with a safety profile allowing continuous dosing to achieve sustained target inhibition. This first-in-human experience demonstrates single-agent activity for patients with advanced breast cancer, NSCLC, and other solid tumors.

However, up to 30% of patients with advanced GCT exhibit cisplatin resistance, which requires intensive salvage treatment, and have a 50% risk of cancer-related death. To identify a genetic basis for cisplatin resistance, we performed whole-exome and targeted sequencing of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Methods Men with GCT who received a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen and had available tumor tissue were eligible to participate in this study. Whole-exome sequencing or targeted exon-capture-based sequencing was performed on 180 tumors. Patients were categorized as cisplatin sensitive or cisplatin resistant by using a combination of postchemotherapy parameters, including serum tumor marker levels, radiology, and pathology at surgical resection of residual disease. Results TP53 alterations were present exclusively in cisplatin-resistant tumors and were particularly prevalent among primary mediastinal nonseminomas (72%). TP53 pathway alterations including MDM2 amplifications were more common among patients with adverse clinical features, categorized as poor risk according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) model. Despite this association, TP53 and MDM2 alterations predicted adverse prognosis independent of the IGCCCG model. Actionable alterations, including novel RAC1 mutations, were detected in 55% of cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Conclusion In GCT, TP53 and MDM2 alterations were associated with cisplatin resistance and inferior outcomes, independent of the IGCCCG model. The finding of frequent TP53 alterations among mediastinal primary nonseminomas may explain the more frequent chemoresistance observed with this tumor subtype. A substantial portion of cisplatin-resistant GCTs harbor actionable alterations, which might respond to targeted therapies. Genomic profiling of patients with advanced GCT could improve current risk stratification and identify novel therapeutic approaches for patients with cisplatin-resistant disease.;;The molecular determinants of clinical responses to decitabine therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are unclear. We enrolled 84 adult patients with AML or MDS in a single-institution trial of decitabine to identify somatic mutations and their relationships to clinical responses. Decitabine was administered at a dose of 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 10 consecutive days in monthly cycles. We performed enhanced exome or gene-panel sequencing in 67 of these patients and serial sequencing at multiple time points to evaluate patterns of mutation clearance in 54 patients. An extension cohort included 32 additional patients who received decitabine in different protocols. Of the 116 patients, 53 (46%) had bone marrow blast clearance (<5% blasts). Response rates were higher among patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile than among patients with an intermediate-risk or favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (29 of 43 patients [67%] vs. 24 of 71 patients [34%], P<0.001) and among patients with TP53 mutations than among patients with wild-type TP53 (21 of 21 [100%] vs. 32 of 78 [41%], P<0.001). Previous studies have consistently shown that patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile and TP53 mutations who receive conventional chemotherapy have poor outcomes. However, in this study of 10-day courses of decitabine, neither of these risk factors was associated with a lower rate of overall survival than the rate of survival among study patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic profiles. Patients with AML and MDS who had cytogenetic abnormalities associated with unfavorable risk, TP53 mutations, or both had favorable clinical responses and robust (but incomplete) mutation clearance after receiving serial 10-day courses of decitabine. Although these responses were not durable, they resulted in rates of overall survival that were similar to those among patients with AML who had an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and who also received serial 10-day courses of decitabine.

In a phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose of AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin demonstrated target engagement. We conducted a proof-of-principle phase II study in patients with p53 tumor suppressor gene ( TP53)-mutated ovarian cancer refractory or resistant (< 3 months) to first-line platinum-based therapy to determine overall response rate, progression-free and overall survival, pharmacokinetics, and modulation of phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1) in skin biopsies. Patients and Methods Patients were treated with carboplatin (area under the curve, 5 mg/mL⋅min) combined with AZD1775 225 mg orally twice daily over 2.5 days every 21-day cycle until disease progression. Results AZD1775 plus carboplatin demonstrated manageable toxicity; fatigue (87%), nausea (78%), thrombocytopenia (70%), diarrhea (70%), and vomiting (48%) were the most common adverse events. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (48%) and neutropenia (37%). Of 24 patients enrolled, 21 patients were evaluable for efficacy end points. The overall response rate was 43% (95% CI, 22% to 66%), including one patient (5%) with a prolonged complete response. Median progression-free and overall survival times were 5.3 months (95% CI, 2.3 to 9.0 months) and 12.6 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 19.7), respectively, with two patients with ongoing response for more than 31 and 42 months at data cutoff. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report providing clinical proof that AZD1775 enhances carboplatin efficacy in TP53-mutated tumors. The encouraging antitumor activity observed in patients with TP53-mutated ovarian cancer who were refractory or resistant (< 3 months) to first-line therapy warrants further development.	;;,,;;,,;;Ray-Coquard I. et al.,Lancet Oncol.,2012,,;;Moser R. et al.,Clin.

To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.;;Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib.

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations.	Iorio F. et al.,Cell,2016

Deregulation of cell cycle kinases, e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can initiate a hyper-proliferative cell phenotype and cause genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation. Pharmacological agents targeting CDKs have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents for over 20 years, evolving from early pan-CDK inhibitors to second-generation inhibitors with much greater specificity and selectivity. Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful preclinical investigations, CDK inhibitors have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical trials. In addition, inhibitors of other cell cycle kinases are currently progressing through clinical trials. Recent biochemical and genetic studies might be used to improve the effectiveness of cell cycle kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer agents through better drug design, therapeutic combinations, and patient selection.;;Novel treatment options, including targeted therapies, are needed for patients with medulloblastoma (MB), especially for those with high-risk or recurrent/relapsed disease. Four major molecular subgroups of MB have been identified, one of which is characterized by activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Preclinical data suggest that inhibitors of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway could become valuable treatment options for patients with this subgroup of MB. Indeed, agents targeting the positive regulator of the pathway, smoothened (SMO), have demonstrated efficacy in a subset of patients with SHH MB. However, because of resistance and the presence of mutations downstream of SMO, not all patients with SHH MB respond to SMO inhibitors. The development of agents that target these resistance mechanisms and the potential for their combination with traditional chemotherapy and SHH inhibitors will be discussed. Due to its extensive molecular heterogeneity, the future of MB treatment is in personalized therapy, which may lead to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. This will include the development of clinically available tests that can efficiently discern the SHH subgroup. The preliminary use of these tests in clinical trials is also discussed herein.	;;;;Stone A. et al.,Crit Rev Oncog,2012;;Kieran MW. et al.,Neuro-oncology,2014

Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.;;Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib.

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.

However, functional consequences of the JAK3 mutations in TMD patients remain undetermined. To further understand how JAK3 mutations are involved in the development and/or progression of leukaemia in Down syndrome, additional TMD patients and the DS-AMKL cell line MGS were screened for JAK3 mutations, and we examined whether each JAK3 mutation is an activating mutation. JAK3 mutations were not detected in 10 TMD samples that had not previously been studied. Together with our previous report we detected JAK3 mutations in one in 11 TMD patients. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time that a TMD patient-derived JAK3 mutation (JAK3(I87T)), as well as two novel JAK3 mutations (JAK3(Q501H) and JAK3(R657Q)) identified in an MGS cell line, were activating mutations. Treatment of MGS cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK3 mutants with JAK3 inhibitors significantly decreased their growth and viability. These results suggest that the JAK3 activating mutation is an early event during leukaemogenesis in Down syndrome, and they provide proof-of-principle evidence that JAK3 inhibitors would have therapeutic effects on TMD and DS-AMKL patients carrying activating JAK3 mutations.

Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.

FISH and microsatellite instability (MSI) analyses were performed. Nine colorectal carcinoma cases harbored ALK gene fusions. Six cases were identified by CGP of 3,157 colorectal carcinoma (0.2%) and three by IHC of 2,980 colorectal carcinoma (0.1%). The ALK fusions involved known ALK partners EML4, C2orf44, CAD, and the novel STRN, PPP1R21, SENPF, MAPRE3, and PRKAP1B partners. These advanced-stage colorectal carcinomas lacked mutations in other oncogenic drivers, predominantly involved the proximal colon, and often exhibited MSI and mucinous phenotype. The index patient was treated with the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, resulting in a marked decrease in size of a skin metastasis, and resolution by computerized tomography of all contrast enhancing tumor. After 9 months of treatment, biopsy of progressive disease demonstrated a KRAS mutation, consistent with acquired resistance to ceritinib.

We detected ALK protein expression by immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in the ALKA-372-001 phase I study of the pan-Trk, ROS1, and ALK inhibitor entrectinib. One out of 487 CRCs showed ALK positivity with a peculiar pattern that prompted further characterisation by targeted sequencing using anchored multiplex PCR. A novel ALK fusion with the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) gene (CAD-ALK fusion gene) was identified. It resulted from inversion within chromosome 2 and the fusion of exons 1-35 of CAD with exons 20-29 of ALK. After failure of previous standard therapies, treatment of this patient with the ALK inhibitor entrectinib resulted in a durable objective tumour response. We describe the novel CAD-ALK rearrangement as an oncogene and provide the first evidence of its drugability as a new molecular target in CRC.,,Chromosomal translocations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinomas and other tumors, recently including rare cases of colorectal carcinoma. We identified a patient with refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma harboring a STRN-ALK gene fusion who achieved an exceptional clinical benefit to the ALK inhibitor ceritinib.

Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3831-40. ©2016 AACR.,,Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rare sarcomas that can occur at any age. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for patients with localized disease; however, these tumors frequently recur. Less commonly, patients with IMTs develop or present with metastatic disease. There is no standard of care for these patients and traditional cytotoxic therapy is largely ineffective. Most IMTs are associated with oncogenic ALK, ROS1 or PDGFRβ fusions and may benefit from targeted therapy. We sought to understand the genomic abnormalities of a patient who presented for management of metastatic IMT after progression of disease on crizotinib and a significant and durable partial response to the more potent ALK inhibitor ceritinib. The residual IMT was resected based on the recommendations of a multidisciplinary tumor sarcoma tumor board and analyzed by whole-genome mate pair sequencing. Analysis of the residual, resected tumor identified a chromoplectic TPM3-ALK rearrangement that involved many other known oncogenes and was confirmed by rtPCR. In our analysis of the treatment-resistant, residual IMT, we identified a complex pattern of genetic rearrangements consistent with chromoplexy. Although it is difficult to know for certain if these chromoplectic rearrangements preceded treatment, their presence suggests that chromoplexy has a role in the oncogenesis of IMTs. Furthermore, this patient's remarkable response suggests that ceritinib should be considered as an option after progression on crizotinib for patients with metastatic or unresectable IMT and ALK mutations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive mesenchymal neoplasm characterized by a spindle-cell proliferation with an inflammatory infiltrate. Approximately half of IMTs carry rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) locus on chromosome 2p23, causing aberrant ALK expression. We report a sustained partial response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066, Pfizer) in a patient with ALK-translocated IMT, as compared with no observed activity in another patient without the ALK translocation. These results support the dependence of ALK-rearranged tumors on ALK-mediated signaling and suggest a therapeutic strategy for genomically identified patients with the aggressive form of this soft-tissue tumor. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).,,;;Patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements often manifest dramatic responses to crizotinib, a small-molecule ALK inhibitor. Unfortunately, not every patient responds and acquired drug resistance inevitably develops in those who do respond. This study aimed to define molecular mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK(+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed tissue obtained from 14 patients with ALK(+) NSCLC showing evidence of radiologic progression while on crizotinib to define mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Eleven patients had material evaluable for molecular analysis. Four patients (36%) developed secondary mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK. A novel mutation in the ALK domain, encoding a G1269A amino acid substitution that confers resistance to crizotinib in vitro, was identified in two of these cases. Two patients, one with a resistance mutation, exhibited new onset ALK copy number gain (CNG). One patient showed outgrowth of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC without evidence of a persistent ALK gene rearrangement. Two patients exhibited a KRAS mutation, one of which occurred without evidence of a persisting ALK gene rearrangement. One patient showed the emergence of an ALK gene fusion-negative tumor compared with the baseline sample but with no identifiable alternate driver. Two patients retained ALK positivity with no identifiable resistance mechanism.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.;;Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are highly responsive to treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

In this phase II study, we evaluated the activity and tolerability of ganetespib in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients were enrolled into cohort A (mutant EGFR), B (mutant KRAS), or C (no EGFR or KRAS mutations). Patients were treated with 200 mg/m(2) ganetespib by intravenous infusion once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest, until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included objective response (ORR), duration of treatment, tolerability, median PFS, overall survival (OS), and correlative studies. Ninety-nine patients with a median of 2 prior systemic therapies were enrolled; 98 were assigned to cohort A (n = 15), B (n = 17), or C (n = 66), with PFS rates at 16 weeks of 13.3%, 5.9%, and 19.7%, respectively. Four patients (4%) achieved partial response (PR); all had disease that harbored anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement, retrospectively detected by FISH (n = 1) or PCR-based assays (n = 3), in crizotinib-naïve patients enrolled to cohort C. Eight patients (8.1%) experienced treatment-related serious adverse events (AE); 2 of these (cardiac arrest and renal failure) resulted in death. The most common AEs were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. Ganetespib monotherapy showed a manageable side effect profile as well as clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLCs, particularly in patients with tumors harboring ALK gene rearrangement.;;Currently, crizotinib is the only drug that has been approved for treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to study the activity and safety of CH5424802, a potent, selective, and orally available ALK inhibitor. In this multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 study of CH5424802, we recruited ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC from 13 hospitals in Japan. In the phase 1 portion of the study, patients received CH5424802 orally twice daily by dose escalation. The primary endpoints of the phase 1 were dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetic parameters. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients received CH5424802 at the recommended dose identified in the phase 1 portion of the study orally twice a day. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 was the proportion of patients who had an objective response. Treatment was continued in 21-day cycles until disease progression, intolerable adverse events, or withdrawal of consent. The analysis was done by intent to treat. This study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-101264. Patients were enrolled between Sept 10, 2010, and April 18, 2012. The data cutoff date was July 31, 2012. In the phase 1 portion, 24 patients were treated at doses of 20-300 mg twice daily. No DLTs or adverse events of grade 4 were noted up to the highest dose; thus 300 mg twice daily was the recommended phase 2 dose. In the phase 2 portion of the study, 46 patients were treated with the recommended dose, of whom 43 achieved an objective response (93.5%, 95% CI 82.1-98.6) including two complete responses (4.3%, 0.5-14.8) and 41 partial responses (89.1%, 76.4-96.4). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 were recorded in 12 (26%) of 46 patients, including two patients each experiencing decreased neutrophil count and increased blood creatine phosphokinase. Serious adverse events occurred in five patients (11%). No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were reported. The study is still ongoing, since 40 of the 46 patients in the phase 2 portion remain on treatment. CH5424802 is well tolerated and highly active in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd.;;Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lymphomas respond to chemotherapy, but relapses, which bear a poor prognosis, occur. Crizotinib inhibits ALK in vitro and in vivo and was administered as monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients who were resistant/refractory to cytotoxic therapy. The overall response rate was 10 of 11 (90.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 58.7% to 99.8%). Disease status at the latest follow-up is as follows: four patients are in complete response (CR) (months >21, >30, >35, >40) under continuous crizotinib administration; 4 patients had progression of disease (months 1, 2, 2, 2); 1 patient obtained CR on crizotinib, received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and is in CR; 2 patients (treated before and/or after allogeneic bone marrow transplant) obtained and are still in CR but they have stopped crizotinib. Overall and progression-free survival rates at 2 years are 72.7% (95% CI = 39.1% to 94.0%) and 63.7% (95% CI = 30.8% to 89.1%), respectively. ALK mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib in vitro could be identified in relapsed patients. Crizotinib exerted a potent antitumor activity with durable responses in advanced, heavily pretreated ALK+ lymphoma patients, with a benign safety profile. ,,;;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01283516.).;;Crizotinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), shows marked activity in patients whose lung cancers harbor fusions in the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), but its efficacy is limited by variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer who had an exceptional response to an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)-specific antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy. Collectively these data support a role for the IGF-1R-IRS-1 pathway in both ALK TKI-sensitive and ALK TKI-resistant states and provide a biological rationale for further clinical development of dual ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. ;;Targeted cancer therapies have produced substantial clinical responses, but most tumors develop resistance to these drugs. Here, we describe a pharmacogenomic platform that facilitates rapid discovery of drug combinations that can overcome resistance. We established cell culture models derived from biopsy samples of lung cancer patients whose disease had progressed while on treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and then subjected these cells to genetic analyses and a pharmacological screen. Multiple effective drug combinations were identified. For example, the combination of ALK and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors was active in an ALK-positive resistant tumor that had developed a MAP2K1 activating mutation, and the combination of EGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors was active in an EGFR mutant resistant cancer with a mutation in FGFR3. Combined ALK and SRC (pp60c-src) inhibition was effective in several ALK-driven patient-derived models, a result not predicted by genetic analysis alone. With further refinements, this strategy could help direct therapeutic choices for individual patients. ;;One strategy for combating cancer-drug resistance is to deploy rational polytherapy up front that suppresses the survival and emergence of resistant tumor cells. Here we demonstrate in models of lung adenocarcinoma harboring the oncogenic fusion of ALK and EML4 that the GTPase RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for tumor-cell survival. EML4-ALK activated RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three major RAS isoforms through the HELP domain of EML4. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway via either a gain in the number of copies of the gene encoding wild-type K-RAS (KRAS(WT)) or decreased expression of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted resistance to ALK inhibitors in vitro, and each was associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors in individuals with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Upfront inhibition of both ALK and the kinase MEK enhanced both the magnitude and duration of the initial response in preclinical models of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings identify RAS-MAPK dependence as a hallmark of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma and provide a rationale for the upfront inhibition of both ALK and MEK to forestall resistance and improve patient outcomes.

To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAF(V600E) promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A).

One approach to increase this understanding involves detailed studies of exceptional responders: rare patients with unexpected exquisite sensitivity or durable responses to therapy. We identified an exceptional responder in a phase I study of pazopanib and everolimus in advanced solid tumors. Whole-exome sequencing of a patient with a 14-month complete response on this trial revealed two concurrent mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus. In vitro experiments demonstrate that both mutations are activating, suggesting a biologic mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus in this patient. The use of precision (or \"personalized\") medicine approaches to screen patients with cancer for alterations in the mTOR pathway may help to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies directed against mTOR.;;Given the modest responses to everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, in multiple tumor types, there is a pressing need to identify predictive biomarkers for this drug. Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors."	Wagle N. et al.,Cancer Discov,2014;;Lim SM. et al.,Oncotarget,2016

Hormonal manipulation leads to response in some patients with EC, but resistance derived from PI3K pathway activation has been documented. Targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may overcome endocrine resistance. We conducted a two-institution phase II trial of everolimus and letrozole in women with recurrent EC. Patients were considered incurable, had measurable disease, and were treated with up to two prior cytotoxic regimens. Everolimus was administered orally at 10 mg daily and letrozole was administered orally at 2.5 mg daily. Each cycle consisted of 4 weeks of therapy. Patients were treated until progression, toxicity, or complete response (CR). The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR), which was defined as CR, partial response, or stable disease (≥ 16 weeks) by RECIST 1.0 criteria. Translational studies were performed to correlate biomarkers with response. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (median age, 62 years; range, 24 to 82 years). Thirty-five patients were evaluable for response. The CBR was 40% (14 of 35 patients); the median number of cycles among responders was 15 (range, seven to 29 cycles). The confirmed objective response rate (RR) was 32% (11 of 35 patients; nine CRs and two partial responses; median, 15 cycles; range, eight to 29 cycles). Twenty percent of patients (seven of 35 patients) were taken off treatment after a prolonged CR and at the discretion of the treating clinician. None of the patients discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity. Serous histology was the best predictor of lack of response. Patients with endometrioid histology and CTNNB1 mutations responded well to everolimus and letrozole. Everolimus plus letrozole results in a high CBR and RR in patients with recurrent EC. Further development of this combination in recurrent endometrioid EC is under way.	Slomovitz BM. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015

However, continued requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and specific small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/β-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting β-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation-driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufficient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that β-catenin-dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efficacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.

The effects of three kinase inhibitors, cabozantinib, crizotinib and EMD1214063, on HGF-driven signaling and cell growth, invasion and tumorigenicity were analyzed in cultured UC cell lines. SW780 xenograft growth in SCID and human HGF knock-in SCID (hHGF/SCID) mice treated with cabozantinib or vehicle, as well as tumor levels of Met and pMet, were also determined. Met content was robust in most UC-derived cell lines. Basal pMet content and effector activation state in quiescent cells were low, but significantly enhanced by added HGF, as were cell invasion, proliferation and anchorage independent growth. These HGF-driven effects were reversed by Met inhibitor treatment. Tumor xenograft growth was significantly higher in hHGF/SCID mice vs. SCID mice and significantly inhibited by cabozantinib, as was tumor phospho-Met content. These studies indicate the prevalence and functionality of the HGF/Met signaling pathway in UC cells, suggest that paracrine HGF may contribute to UC tumor growth and progression, and that support further preclinical investigation of Met inhibitors for the treatment of UC is warranted.

Through a high-throughput drug screen of a large panel of cancer cell lines, including 17 biliary tract cancers, we found that IDH mutant (IDHm) ICC cells demonstrate a striking response to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, with the highest sensitivity among 682 solid tumor cell lines. Using unbiased proteomics to capture the activated kinome and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to introduce dasatinib-resistant \"gatekeeper\" mutant kinases, we identified SRC as a critical dasatinib target in IDHm ICC. Importantly, dasatinib-treated IDHm xenografts exhibited pronounced apoptosis and tumor regression. Our results show that IDHm ICC cells have a unique dependency on SRC and suggest that dasatinib may have therapeutic benefit against IDHm ICC. Moreover, these proteomic and genome-editing strategies provide a systematic and broadly applicable approach to define targets of kinase inhibitors underlying drug responsiveness. IDH mutations define a distinct subtype of ICC, a malignancy that is largely refractory to current therapies. Our work demonstrates that IDHm ICC cells are hypersensitive to dasatinib and critically dependent on SRC activity for survival and proliferation, pointing to new therapeutic strategies against these cancers.

Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria.

Twelve (38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profiling was consistent with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identified potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/refractory or unfit for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profile in this phase II study.

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.

A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.,,Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibodies represents a clinical challenge in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors such as metastatic colorectal cancer, but its molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. We scanned KRAS exon 2/3/4, NRAS exon 2/3/4 and the overlapping epitopes of the EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for mutations in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue of 21 patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated with chemotherapy +/- EGFR antibodies by next-generation sequencing (\"tumor tissue\" cohort). We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring EGFR-targeted therapies. ,,Patients with colorectal cancer who respond to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab often develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. To design new lines of treatment, the molecular landscape of resistant tumors must be ascertained. We investigated the role of mutations in the EGFR signaling axis on the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab in patients and cellular models. Tissue samples were obtained from 37 patients with colorectal cancer who became refractory to cetuximab. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance. The genetic profile of tumor specimens obtained after cetuximab treatment revealed the emergence of a complex pattern of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes, including two novel EGFR ectodomain mutations (R451C and K467T). Mutational profiling of cetuximab-resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR alleles: S464L, G465R, and I491M. Structurally, these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for the R451C mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab. Colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signaling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding. Both mechanisms of resistance may occur concomitantly. Our data have implications for designing additional lines of therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who relapse upon treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.,,Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--cetuximab and panitumumab--are widely used to treat colorectal cancer.

However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy. Sym004 is an active drug in MCRC resistant to cetuximab/panitumumab mediated by EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are potential biomarkers of response to Sym004 to be evaluated in ongoing large clinical trials. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3260-7. ©2016 AACR.;;Tumor growth in the context of EGFR inhibitor resistance may remain EGFR-dependent and is mediated by mechanisms including compensatory ligand upregulation and de novo gene alterations. Sym004 is a two-antibody mixture targeting nonoverlapping EGFR epitopes. In preclinical models, Sym004 causes significant EGFR internalization and degradation, which translates into superior growth inhibition in the presence of ligands. In this phase I trial, we observed grade 3 skin toxicity and hypomagnesemia as mechanism-based dose-limiting events during dose escalation. In dose-expansion cohorts of 9 and 12 mg/kg of Sym004 weekly, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and acquired EGFR inhibitor resistance were enrolled; 17 of 39 patients (44%) had tumor shrinkage, with 5 patients (13%) achieving partial response. Pharmacodynamic studies confirmed marked Sym004-induced EGFR downmodulation. MET gene amplification emerged in 1 patient during Sym004 treatment, and a partial response was seen in a patient with EGFR(S492R) mutation that is predictive of cetuximab resistance. Potent EGFR downmodulation with Sym004 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and acquired resistance to cetuximab/panitumumab translates into significant antitumor activity and validates the preclinical hypothesis that a proportion of tumors remains dependent on EGFR signaling. Further clinical development and expanded correlative analyses of response patterns with secondary RAS/EGFR mutations are warranted."	Montagut C. et al.,Nat. Med.,2012;;Montagut C. et al.,Nat.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Here, we show that the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib induced loss of EML4-ALK expression and depletion of multiple oncogenic signaling proteins in ALK-driven NSCLC cells, leading to greater in vitro potency, superior antitumor efficacy, and prolonged animal survival compared with results obtained with crizotinib. In addition, combinatorial benefit was seen when ganetespib was used with other targeted ALK agents both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, ganetespib overcame multiple forms of crizotinib resistance, including secondary ALK mutations, consistent with activity seen in a patient with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC. Cancer cells driven by ALK amplification and oncogenic rearrangements of ROS1 and RET kinase genes were also sensitive to ganetespib exposure. Taken together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of ganetespib for ALK-driven NSCLC. In addition to direct kinase inhibition, pharmacologic blockade of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is emerging as a promising approach for treating tumors driven by oncogenic rearrangements of ALK. The bioactivity profi le of ganetespib presented here underscores a new therapeutic opportunity to target ALK and overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.;;Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasm that typically occurs in children. The genetic landscape of this tumor is incompletely understood and therapeutic options are limited. Although 50% of IMTs harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, no therapeutic targets have been identified in ALK-negative tumors. We report for the first time that IMTs harbor other actionable targets, including ROS1 and PDGFRβ fusions. We detail the case of an 8-year-old boy with treatment-refractory ALK-negative IMT. Molecular tumor profiling revealed a ROS1 fusion, and he had a dramatic response to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. This case prompted assessment of a larger series of IMTs. Next-generation sequencing revealed that 85% of cases evaluated harbored kinase fusions involving ALK, ROS1, or PDGFRβ. Our study represents the most comprehensive genetic analysis of IMTs to date and also provides a rationale for routine molecular profiling of these tumors to detect therapeutically actionable kinase fusions. Our study describes the most comprehensive genomics-based evaluation of IMT to date. Because there is no \"standard-of-care\" therapy for IMT, the identification of actionable genomic alterations, in addition to ALK, is expected to redefine management strategies for patients with this disease.;;Chromosomal rearrangements of the gene encoding ROS1 proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) define a distinct molecular subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that may be susceptible to therapeutic ROS1 kinase inhibition. Crizotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, and another proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. We enrolled 50 patients with advanced NSCLC who tested positive for ROS1 rearrangement in an expansion cohort of the phase 1 study of crizotinib. Patients were treated with crizotinib at the standard oral dose of 250 mg twice daily and assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and response to therapy. ROS1 fusion partners were identified with the use of next-generation sequencing or reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. The objective response rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 84), with 3 complete responses and 33 partial responses. The median duration of response was 17.6 months (95% CI, 14.5 to not reached). Median progression-free survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.4 to not reached), with 25 patients (50%) still in follow-up for progression. Among 30 tumors that were tested, we identified 7 ROS1 fusion partners: 5 known and 2 novel partner genes. No correlation was observed between the type of ROS1 rearrangement and the clinical response to crizotinib. The safety profile of crizotinib was similar to that seen in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. In this study, crizotinib showed marked antitumor activity in patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. ROS1 rearrangement defines a second molecular subgroup of NSCLC for which crizotinib is highly active. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).;;Efforts to discover drugs that overcome resistance to targeted therapies in patients with rare oncogenic alterations, such as NTRK1 and ROS1 rearrangements, are complicated by the cost and protracted timeline of drug discovery. In an effort to identify inhibitors of NTRK1 and ROS1, which are aberrantly activated in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we created and screened a library of existing targeted drugs against Ba/F3 cells transformed with these oncogenes. This screen identified the FDA-approved drug cabozantinib as a potent inhibitor of CD74-ROS1-transformed Ba/F3, including the crizotinib-resistant mutants G2032R and L2026M (IC50 = 9, 26, and 11 nmol/L, respectively). Cabozantinib inhibited CD74-ROS1-transformed Ba/F3 cells more potently than brigatinib (wild-type/G2032R/L2026M IC50 = 30/170/200 nmol/L, respectively), entrectinib (IC50 = 6/2,200/3,500 nmol/L), and PF-06463922 (IC50 = 1/270/2 nmol/L). Cabozantinib inhibited ROS1 autophosphorylation and downstream ERK activation in transformed Ba/F3 cells and in patient-derived tumor cell lines. The IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-536924 potently inhibited CD74-NTRK1-transformed compared with parental Ba/F3 cells (IC50 = 19 nmol/L vs. > 470 nmol/L). A patient with metastatic ROS1-rearranged NSCLC with progression on crizotinib was treated with cabozantinib and experienced a partial response. While acquired resistance to targeted therapies is challenging, this study highlights that existing agents may be repurposed to overcome drug resistance and identifies cabozantinib as a promising treatment of ROS1-rearranged NSCLC after progression on crizotinib.

In this study, we present therapeutically relevant genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma of Indian origin. Forty-five primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors were sequenced for 676 amplicons using RainDance cancer panel at an average coverage of 1500 × (reads per million mapped reads). To validate the findings, 49 mutations across 23 genes were genotyped in an additional set of 363 primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors using mass spectrometry. NIH/3T3 cells over expressing mutant and wild-type FGFR3 constructs were characterized for anchorage independent growth, constitutive activation, tumor formation and sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors using in vitro and xenograft mouse models. We present the first spectrum of actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinoma tumors of Indian origin, and shows that mutations of FGFR3 are present in 20 of 363 (5.5%) patients. These FGFR3 mutations are constitutively active and oncogenic when ectopically expressed in NIH/3T3 cells and using a xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice. Inhibition of FGFR3 kinase activity inhibits transformation of NIH/3T3 overexpressing FGFR3 constructs and growth of tumors driven by FGFR3 in the xenograft models. The reduction in tumor size in the mouse is paralleled by a reduction in the amounts of phospho-ERK, validating the in vitro findings. Interestingly, the FGFR3 mutations are significantly higher in a proportion of younger patients and show a trend toward better overall survival, compared with patients lacking actionable alterations or those harboring KRAS mutations. We present the first actionable mutation spectrum in Indian lung cancer genome. These findings implicate FGFR3 as a novel therapeutic in lung adenocarcinoma.	Chandrani P. et al.,Ann. Oncol.,2017

The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.;;Molecular characterization of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloproliferative disorders, such as systemic mastocytosis (SM), has provided a clear rationale for investigating novel targeted therapies. The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor dasatinib is 325-fold more potent against Bcr-Abl TK than imatinib in vitro, significantly inhibiting wild-type KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs, and is active against cells carrying the mutant KIT-D816V gene. In this phase 2, open-label study, the efficacy of dasatinib (140 mg/d) was investigated in 67 patients with various Ph- myeloid disorders, including SM (n = 33; 28 KIT-D816V positive). The overall response rate to dasatinib in patients with SM was 33%. Only two patients, one with SM-myelofibrosis and one with SM-chronic eosinophilic leukemia, achieved complete response (elimination of mastocytosis) lasting for 5 and 16 months, respectively. Both patients were negative for KIT-D816V mutation, had low tryptase levels, abnormal WBC counts, and anemia, and had failed prior therapy with erythropoietin. Additional nine SM patients had symptomatic response, lasting 3 to 18+ months. Complete responses were achieved in two other patients (acute myeloid leukemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome). No responses were observed among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and primary myelofibrosis. The majority of adverse events were grade 1/2. These data show that dasatinib therapy may benefit a selected group of SM patients, primarily by improving their symptoms, but it does not eliminate the disease in the patients with KIT-D816V mutation.;;Dasatinib has been reported to potently inhibit juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT(D816V) autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of down stream signaling important for cell growth and survival of neoplastic cells. Additionally, dasatinib induced apoptosis in mast cell and leukemia cell lines expressing KIT(D816V). Here, we present the first case report of long-term hematologic and molecular remission achieved with combined treatment with chemotherapy and dasatinib in a patient with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutant KIT(D816V) expression. A 50-year-old male presented with pancytopenia, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lytic bone lesions in the pelvis. The patient was found to have systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) positive for KIT(D816V) and therefore diagnosed with SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). Both primary CD34+ cells containing myeloblasts and CD34- cells containing mastocytes obtained from the diagnostic BM lost viability markedly by in vitro dasatinib treatment. In addition, dasatinib diminished activity of STAT5, STAT3, AKT and ERK and attenuated the levels of c-KIT. The patient achieved a hematologic complete remission (HCR) by two induction chemotherapies with residual mastocytes. Dasatinib (70mg PO bid, days 1-4) was added to consolidation treatments composed of four cycles of high dose cytarabine and was then continued as maintenance therapy (50mg PO bid). Periodic bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsies (eight over 18 months) were performed. The patient remained in HCR, and the mastocyte burden decreased by 50%. The bone lytic lesions improved. The KIT(D816V)mutation progressively decreased and became undetectable in the last three BM analyses. This result was confirmed by an independent laboratory showing a lack of c-KIT mutation in both CD34+ cells and CD34- cells in the last BM. No significant adverse effects of dasatinib occurred. Dasatinib has in vitro and in vivo efficacy in SM-AML patients with KIT(D816V) mutation. Along with chemotherapy, dasatinib should be considered in these patients particularly if they cannot undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation for this poor prognostic AML.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

is an oral, highly selective inhibitor of AKT. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 was evaluated in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received a single oral dose of MK-2206 according to an every other day (QOD) dosing schedule or a once weekly (QW) dosing schedule in repeating 28-day treatment cycles, with a 7-day rest after only the first cycle. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during Cycle 1. Full PK sampling was performed during Cycle 1. Twenty-four patients were treated at 45 mg (n = 3) or 60 mg (n = 9) QOD or at 135 mg (n = 3) or 200 mg (n = 9) QW. One patient experienced a DLT at 60 mg QOD, and three patients experienced DLTs at 200 mg QW. No DLTs were observed at 45 mg QOD or at 135 mg QW. The DLTs included mucosal inflammation, hyponatremia, face edema, erythema multiforme, and hyperglycemia. Common adverse events related to MK-2206 included rash, an elevated insulin c-peptide level, stomatitis, pyrexia, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and hyperglycemia. PK differences in MK-2206 exposure were observed between Japanese patients and non-Japanese patients. The higher exposure in Japanese patients was likely caused by the relatively lower weight of Japanese patients versus non-Japanese patients. No tumor responses were observed, but six patients exhibited stable disease lasting longer than 4 months. MK-2206 has an acceptable safety profile in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors and warrants further investigation.;;,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,To evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of single-agent monoclonal antibody therapy targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu receptor in ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinoma. Eligible patients had measurable persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma with 2+ or 3+ HER2 overexpression documented by immunohistochemistry. Intravenous trastuzumab was administered initially at a dose of 4 mg/kg, then weekly at 2 mg/kg. Patients without progressive disease or excessive toxicity could continue treatment indefinitely. Those with stable or responding disease at 8 weeks were offered treatment at a higher weekly dose (4 mg/kg) at time of progression. Patient sera were analyzed for the presence of the soluble extracellular domain of HER2, host antibodies against trastuzumab, and trastuzumab pharmacokinetics. A total of 837 tumor samples were screened for HER2 expression, and 95 patients (11.4%) exhibited the requisite 2+/3+ expression level. Forty-five patients, all of whom received prior chemotherapy, were entered, and 41 were deemed eligible and assessable. There were only mild expected toxicities and no treatment-related deaths. Although an elevated level of the soluble extracellular domain of HER2 was detected in eight of 24 patients, serum HER2 was not associated with clinical outcome. There was no evidence of host antitrastuzumab antibody formation. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab gradually increased with continued therapy. An overall response rate of 7.3% included one complete and two partial responses. Median treatment duration was 8 weeks (range, 2 to 104 weeks), and median progression-free interval was 2.0 months. The clinical value of single-agent trastuzumab in recurrent ovarian cancer is limited by the low frequency of HER2 overexpression and low rate of objective response among patients with HER2 overexpression.;;Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of neratinib were evaluated in two cohorts of patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer-those with and those without prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral neratinib 240 mg once daily. The primary end point was the 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed by independent review. The 16-week PFS rates were 59% for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 78% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Median PFS was 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, respectively. Objective response rates were 24% among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% in the trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse event, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13% of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions in 29% and 4% of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported. Oral neratinib showed substantial clinical activity and was reasonably well tolerated among both heavily pretreated and trastuzumab-naïve patients who had advanced, ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification.,,Afatinib is an oral, ErbB family blocker, which covalently binds and irreversibly blocks all kinase-competent ErbB family members. This phase II, open-label, single-arm study explored afatinib activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients progressing after trastuzumab treatment. Patients had stage IIIB/IV HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with progression following trastuzumab or trastuzumab intolerance and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0), with tumor assessments every 8 weeks. Forty-one patients were treated. Patients had received a median of three prior chemotherapy lines (range, 0-15) and 68.3% had received trastuzumab for >1 year. Four patients (10% of 41 treated; 11% of evaluable patients) had partial response. Fifteen patients (37% of 41) had stable disease as best response and 19 (46% of 41) achieved clinical benefit. Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-16.7); median overall survival was 61.0 weeks (95% CI: 56.7-not evaluable). Most frequent common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (24.4%) and rash (9.8%). Afatinib monotherapy was associated with promising clinical activity in extensively pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had progressed following trastuzumab treatment.,,Neratinib is a potent irreversible pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2-positive breast cancer and other solid tumours. This was a phase I/II, open-label, two-part study. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neratinib plus paclitaxel in patients with solid tumours. Part 2 evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of the combination at the MTD in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Eight patients were included in the dose-escalation study; no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and an MTD of oral neratinib 240 mg once daily plus intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg m(-2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle was determined. A total of 102 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled in part 2. The overall median treatment duration was 47.9 weeks (range: 0.1-147.3 weeks). Common treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades/grade ≥3) included diarrhoea (92%/29%; none grade 4), peripheral sensory neuropathy (51%/3%), neutropenia (50%/20%), alopecia (46%/0%), leukopenia (41%/18%), anaemia (37%/8%), and nausea (34%/1%). Three (3%) patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (mouth ulceration, left ventricular ejection fraction reduction, and acute renal failure). Among the 99 evaluable patients in part 2 of the study, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.9-81.2%), including 7 (7%) patients who achieved a complete response; an additional 9 (9%) patients achieved stable disease for at least 24 weeks. ORR was 71% among patients with 0/1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and no prior lapatinib, and 77% among those with 2/3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease with prior lapatinib permitted. Kaplan-Meier median progression-free survival was 57.0 weeks (95% CI: 47.7-81.6 weeks). Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no interaction between neratinib and paclitaxel. The combination of neratinib and paclitaxel was associated with higher toxicity than that of neratinib as a single agent, but was manageable with antidiarrhoeal agents and dose reductions in general. The combination therapy also demonstrated a high rate of response in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. A phase III trial is ongoing to assess the benefit and risk of this combination in the first-line setting.;;Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of neratinib were evaluated in two cohorts of patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer-those with and those without prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral neratinib 240 mg once daily. The primary end point was the 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed by independent review. The 16-week PFS rates were 59% for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 78% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Median PFS was 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, respectively. Objective response rates were 24% among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% in the trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse event, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13% of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions in 29% and 4% of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported. Oral neratinib showed substantial clinical activity and was reasonably well tolerated among both heavily pretreated and trastuzumab-naïve patients who had advanced, ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification.,,Afatinib is an oral, ErbB family blocker, which covalently binds and irreversibly blocks all kinase-competent ErbB family members. This phase II, open-label, single-arm study explored afatinib activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients progressing after trastuzumab treatment. Patients had stage IIIB/IV HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with progression following trastuzumab or trastuzumab intolerance and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0), with tumor assessments every 8 weeks. Forty-one patients were treated. Patients had received a median of three prior chemotherapy lines (range, 0-15) and 68.3% had received trastuzumab for >1 year. Four patients (10% of 41 treated; 11% of evaluable patients) had partial response. Fifteen patients (37% of 41) had stable disease as best response and 19 (46% of 41) achieved clinical benefit. Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-16.7); median overall survival was 61.0 weeks (95% CI: 56.7-not evaluable). Most frequent common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (24.4%) and rash (9.8%). Afatinib monotherapy was associated with promising clinical activity in extensively pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had progressed following trastuzumab treatment.,,Neratinib is a potent irreversible pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2-positive breast cancer and other solid tumours. This was a phase I/II, open-label, two-part study. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neratinib plus paclitaxel in patients with solid tumours. Part 2 evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of the combination at the MTD in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Eight patients were included in the dose-escalation study; no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and an MTD of oral neratinib 240 mg once daily plus intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg m(-2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle was determined. A total of 102 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled in part 2. The overall median treatment duration was 47.9 weeks (range: 0.1-147.3 weeks). Common treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades/grade ≥3) included diarrhoea (92%/29%; none grade 4), peripheral sensory neuropathy (51%/3%), neutropenia (50%/20%), alopecia (46%/0%), leukopenia (41%/18%), anaemia (37%/8%), and nausea (34%/1%). Three (3%) patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (mouth ulceration, left ventricular ejection fraction reduction, and acute renal failure). Among the 99 evaluable patients in part 2 of the study, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.9-81.2%), including 7 (7%) patients who achieved a complete response; an additional 9 (9%) patients achieved stable disease for at least 24 weeks. ORR was 71% among patients with 0/1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and no prior lapatinib, and 77% among those with 2/3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease with prior lapatinib permitted. Kaplan-Meier median progression-free survival was 57.0 weeks (95% CI: 47.7-81.6 weeks). Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no interaction between neratinib and paclitaxel. The combination of neratinib and paclitaxel was associated with higher toxicity than that of neratinib as a single agent, but was manageable with antidiarrhoeal agents and dose reductions in general. The combination therapy also demonstrated a high rate of response in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. A phase III trial is ongoing to assess the benefit and risk of this combination in the first-line setting.;;To determine the feasible dose and schedule for everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, combined with vinorelbine and trastuzumab for patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab. In this phase Ib multicenter, Bayesian dose-escalation study, 50 patients received everolimus 5 mg/day, 20 mg/week, or 30 mg/week plus vinorelbine (25 mg/m² on day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg weekly). Endpoints included end-of-cycle-1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate (primary endpoint), safety, relative dose intensity, overall response rate (ORR), and pharmacokinetics. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was the most common end-of-cycle-1 DLT and occurred in 10 of 30 and 4 of 14 patients in the 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week cohorts, respectively. Other end-of-cycle-1 DLTs included single cases of febrile neutropenia, grade 3 stomatitis with concomitant fatigue, grade 2 stomatitis, grade 3 anorexia, and grade 2 acneiform dermatitis, all in the 5-mg/day cohort. Based on the recorded DLTs and global safety, everolimus 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week were chosen as the optimal dose levels for the daily and weekly arms. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for efficacy. ORR was 19.1%, with a disease control rate of 83.0% and median progression-free survival of 30.7 weeks. No drug interaction was observed between everolimus and vinorelbine. Everolimus combined with weekly vinorelbine and trastuzumab generally was well tolerated and had encouraging antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that progressed on trastuzumab (NCT00426530).,,To determine the recommended dose of everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab. In this phase Ib, multicenter, dose-escalation study, patients were treated with everolimus 5 mg/d, 10 mg/d, or 30 mg/wk in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg weekly). End points included end-of-cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate (primary end point), safety, relative dose intensity of study drugs, overall response rate (ORR), and pharmacokinetics. Of 33 patients enrolled, 31 were pretreated with taxanes, and 32 were resistant to trastuzumab. Patients received a median of two lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (range, 0 to 17 lines). Three patients experienced cycle 1 DLTs: febrile neutropenia (5 mg/d), stomatitis (10 mg/d), and confusion (30 mg/wk). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was the most common toxicity observed (n = 17 patients [52%]). On the basis of observed DLTs and overall safety, 10 mg/d was recommended for additional development. Twenty-seven patients had measurable disease and were evaluable for efficacy. Among these patients, ORR was 44%. Overall disease was controlled for 6 months or more in 74%. Median progression-free survival was 34 weeks (95% CI, 29.1 to 40.7 weeks). Among 11 patients who were resistant to both trastuzumab and taxane, a similar level of antitumor activity was observed (ORR, 55%). Everolimus combined with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab was generally well tolerated and had encouraging antitumor activity in patients with trastuzumab-pretreated and -resistant metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.;;Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare subtype of salivary gland carcinoma and is considered to be a high-grade aggressive tumor with morphological resemblance to ductal carcinoma of the breast. We present a case of a patient who suffered from metastatic SDC that was positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and attained complete objective response, as seen on PET-CT after combined treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab.;;HSP90 is a chaperone protein required for the stability of a variety of client proteins. 17-Demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is a natural product that binds to HSP90 and inhibits its activity, thereby inducing the degradation of these clients. In preclinical studies, HER2 is one of the most sensitive known client proteins of 17-AAG. On the basis of these data and activity in a phase I study, we conducted a phase II study of 17-AAG (tanespimycin) with trastuzumab in advanced trastuzumab-refractory HER2-positive breast cancer. We enrolled patients with metastatic HER2(+) breast cancer whose disease had previously progressed on trastuzumab. All patients received weekly treatment with tanespimycin at 450 mg/m(2) intravenously and trastuzumab at a conventional dose. Therapy was continued until disease progression. The primary endpoint was response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Thirty-one patients were enrolled with a median age of 53 years and a median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 90%. The most common toxicities, largely grade 1, were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and headache. The overall response rate was 22%, the clinical benefit rate [complete response + partial response + stable disease] was 59%, the median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI: 4-9), and the median overall survival was 17 months (95% CI: 16-28). This is the first phase II study to definitively show RECIST-defined responses for 17-AAG in solid tumors. Tanespimycin plus trastuzumab has significant anticancer activity in patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer previously progressing on trastuzumab. Further research exploring this therapeutic interaction and the activity of HSP90 inhibitors is clearly warranted.;;Only a fraction of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receive clinical benefit from therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, which calls for the identification of novel biomarkers for better personalized medicine. We produced large xenograft cohorts from 85 patient-derived, genetically characterized metastatic colorectal cancer samples (\"xenopatients\") to discover novel determinants of therapeutic response and new oncoprotein targets. Serially passaged tumors retained the morphologic and genomic features of their original counterparts. A validation trial confirmed the robustness of this approach: xenopatients responded to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab with rates and extents analogous to those observed in the clinic and could be prospectively stratified as responders or nonresponders on the basis of several predictive biomarkers. Genotype-response correlations indicated HER2 amplification specifically in a subset of cetuximab-resistant, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type cases. Importantly, HER2 amplification was also enriched in clinically nonresponsive KRAS wild-type patients. A proof-of-concept, multiarm study in HER2-amplified xenopatients revealed that the combined inhibition of HER2 and EGFR induced overt, long-lasting tumor regression. Our results suggest promising therapeutic opportunities in cetuximab-resistant patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, whose medical treatment in the chemorefractory setting remains an unmet clinical need. Direct transfer xenografts of tumor surgical specimens conserve the interindividual diversity and the genetic heterogeneity typical of the tumors of origin, combining the flexibility of preclinical analysis with the informative value of population-based studies. Our suite of patient-derived xenografts from metastatic colorectal carcinomas reliably mimicked disease response in humans, prospectively recapitulated biomarker-based case stratification, and identified HER2 as a predictor of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and of response to combination therapies against HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor in this tumor setting.,,In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), KRAS is the only validated biomarker used to select patients for administration of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies. To identify additional predictive markers, we investigated the importance of HER2, the primary EGFR dimerisation partner, in this particular disease. We evaluated the HER2 gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 170 KRAS wild-type mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab. Depending on HER2 gene copy number status, patients showed three distinct cytogenetic profiles: 4% of patients had HER2 gene amplification (R:HER2/CEP17 ≥ 2) in all neoplastic cells (HER2-all-A), 61% of patients had HER2 gain due to polysomy or to gene amplification in minor clones (HER2-FISH+*), and 35% of patients had no or slight HER2 gain (HER2-FISH-). These subgroups were significantly correlated with different clinical behaviours, in terms of response rate (RR; P=0.0006), progression-free survival (PFS; P<0.0001) and overall survival (OS; P<0.0001). Patients with HER2-all-A profile experienced the worst outcome, patients with HER2-FISH- profile showed an intermediate behaviour and patients with HER2-FISH+* profile were related to the highest survival probability (median PFS in months: 2.5 vs 3.9 vs 7.6, respectively; median OS in months: 4.2 vs 9.7 vs 13, respectively). HER2 gene copy number status may influence the clinical response to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy in mCRC patients.;;EGF receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancers eventually become resistant to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The combination of EGFR-TKI afatinib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human patients. Because afatinib is also a potent HER2 inhibitor, we investigated the role of HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumor cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. FISH analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR(T790M) were mutually exclusive. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.;;Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.;;Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone. Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC). Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B). Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety. Thirty patients were randomised. Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 μg ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 μg ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer. The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated. Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.;;Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer that commonly harbors HER2 gene amplification. We investigated the effectiveness of HER2 inhibition using lapatinib and trastuzumab in vitro and in xenografts derived from USC cell lines and USC patient-derived xenografts. Immunohistochemistry and FISH were performed to assess HER2 expression in 42 primary USC specimens. ARK1, ARK2, and SPEC2 cell lines were treated with trastuzumab or lapatinib. Cohorts of mice harboring xenografts derived from ARK2 and SPEC2 cell lines and EnCa1 and EnCa2 primary human USC samples were treated with either vehicle, trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib. Acute and chronic posttreatment tumor samples were assessed for downstream signaling alterations and examined for apoptosis and proliferation. HER2 gene amplification (24%) correlated significantly with HER2 protein overexpression (55%). All models were impervious to single-agent trastuzumab treatment. Lapatinib decreased in vitro proliferation of all cell lines and in vivo growth of HER2-amplified xenografts (ARK2, EnCa1). In addition, dual therapy with trastuzumab and lapatinib resulted in significant antitumor activity only in ARK2 and EnCa1 tumors. Dual HER2 therapy induced on target alteration of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathway mediators only in HER2-amplified models, and was associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Although trastuzumab alone did not impact USC growth, dual anti-HER2 therapy with lapatinib led to improved inhibition of tumor growth in HER2-amplified USC and may be a promising avenue for future investigation.;;Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification is present in a subgroup of gastroo-esophageal cancers (GCs). HER2 inhibition with trastuzumab has shown to improve outcomes in advanced disease. Lapatinib ditosylate (LAP), a dual anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity against GC, has been approved in HER2-positive breast cancer. We aimed to study the activity of LAP in HER2-amplified GC. Patients (pts) with HER2-positive (gene amplification or increased copy numbers based on predefined criteria) advanced GC were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive LAP 1250mg per day 1-21 plus capecitabine (CAP) 2000mg/m(2) on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle or LAP 1500mg monotherapy day 1-21 after having failed on a platinum-based first-line therapy. HER2 status was assessed centrally. The primary end-point was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). We aimed to include 38 pts per arm to show an interesting response rate of ⩾20% in either of the two arms. 37 pts were enrolled (18 to LAP+CAP, 19 to LAP). Pts had received a median of three prior treatment lines. 12 pts in the LAP+CAP group (67%) and 12 pts in the LAP group (63%) had received prior trastuzumab. Only two pts (11.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-34.7), both in the LAP+CAP arm, achieved an objective response. The study was closed prematurely for futility. Median time to progression was 42 (95% CI: 38-61) days in the LAP group and 83 (95% CI: 42-86) days in the LAP+CAP group. Other secondary efficacy end-points (progression-free and overall survival) were comparable in the two treatment groups. Rates of diarrhoea were higher with LAP+CAP (61%; 95% CI: 35-83) compared to 26% (95% CI 9-51) with LAP mono, whereas other adverse events were mostly similar between the groups (18 [100%] versus 17 [90%]). Lapatinib showed insufficient activity in HER2-amplified pretreated advanced GC. The safety profile of LAP or LAP+CAP was as expected with some more toxicity in the combination arm. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT01145404).,,;;HER2 mutations and amplifications have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers. Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers. As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity. We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine. Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions. This observation validates HER2 exon 20 insertions as actionable targets and justifies further study of HER2-targeted agents in specific HER2-driven lung cancers. NCT00818441.;;;;;;;;Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, diagnosed in more than 50,000 women annually. While the majority of women present with low-grade tumors that are cured with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, a significant subset of women experience recurrence and do not survive their disease. A disproportionate number of the more than 8,000 annual deaths attributed to endometrial cancer are due to high-grade uterine cancers, highlighting the need for new therapies that target molecular alterations specific to this subset of tumors. Numerous correlative scientific investigations have demonstrated that the HER2 (ERBB2) gene is amplified in 17%-33% of carcinosarcoma, uterine serous carcinoma, and a subset of high-grade endometrioid endometrial tumors. In breast cancer, this potent signature has directed women to anti-HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and lapatinib. In contrast to breast cancer, therapy with trastuzumab alone revealed no responses in women with recurrent HER2 overexpressing endometrial cancer, suggesting that these tumors may possess acquired or innate trastuzumab resistance mechanisms. This review explores the literature surrounding HER2 expression in endometrial cancer, focusing on trastuzumab and other anti-HER2 therapy and resistance mechanisms characterized in breast cancer but germane to endometrial tumors. Understanding resistance pathways will suggest combination therapies that target both HER2 and key oncogenic escape pathways in endometrial cancer. This review summarizes the role of HER2 in endometrial cancer, with a focus on uterine serous carcinoma. The limitations to date of anti-HER2 therapy in this disease site are examined, and mechanisms of drug resistance are outlined based on the experience in breast cancer. Potential opportunities to overcome inherent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in endometrial cancer are detailed, offering opportunities for further clinical study with the goal to improve outcomes in this challenging disease.,,This study evaluated efficacy of single-agent trastuzumab against advanced or recurrent HER2-positive endometrial carcinoma (EC), and explored predictors for HER2 amplification. Eligible patients had measurable stage III, IV, or recurrent EC. There was no limit on prior therapy although total prior doxorubicin dose was limited to 320 mg/m(2). Tumors were required to have HER2 overexpression (2+ or 3+ immunohistochemical staining) or HER2 amplification (FISH HER2/CEP 17 ratio >2.0). Trastuzumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 4 mg/kg in week 1, then 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression. The primary endpoint was tumor response. Of the 286 tumors centrally screened by LabCorp, 33 (11.5%) were HER2-amplified. Three of 8 clear (38%) cell carcinomas and 7 of 25 serous carcinomas (28%) screened exhibited HER2 amplification compared with 7% (2/29) of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. HER2 overexpression was correlated with HER2 amplification (r=0.459; p<0.0001). Thirty-four women were enrolled; 1 was excluded (refused treatment); and 18 had tumors with known HER2 amplification. No major tumor responses were observed. Twelve women experienced stable disease, 18 had increasing disease, and 3 were indeterminate for tumor response. Neither HER2 overexpression nor HER2 amplification appeared to be associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. Trastuzumab as a single agent did not demonstrate activity against endometrial carcinomas with HER2 overexpression or HER2 amplification, although full planned accrual of women with HER2 amplified tumors was not achieved due to slow recruitment. Serous and clear cell endometrial carcinomas appear to be more likely to demonstrate HER2 amplification.;;HER2 mutations have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers and are found in 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas. There is, to date, no standard of care for these patients. We thus aim to study the therapeutic outcomes of patients harboring HER2 mutations and establish the efficacy of various drug regimens. This retrospective cohort study in European centers assessed patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a known HER2 exon-20 insertion, treated with chemotherapy and/or HER2-targeted drugs. We identified 101 eligible patients from 38 centers: median age 61 years (range: 30-87), 62.4% women, 60.4% never-smokers. All tumors were adenocarcinomas. Concomitant EGFR mutations, ALK translocations, and ROS translocations were observed in 5, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. The median number of treatment lines was 3 (range: 1-11). The median overall survival was 24 months. Overall response rate (ORR) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) with conventional chemotherapy (excluding targeted therapies) were 43.5% and 6 months in first-line (n = 93), and 10% and 4.3 months in second-line (n = 52) therapies. Sixty-five patients received HER2-targeted therapies: trastuzumab = 57, neratinib = 14, afatinib = 9, lapatinib = 5, T-DM1 = 1. ORR was 50.9% and PFS was 4.8 months with trastuzumab or T-DM1. This series shows the chemosensitivity of HER2-driven NSCLC, and the potential interest of HER2-targeted agents. Our results should help to define the best therapeutic strategy for these patients and to orient future clinical trials.;;HER2 mutations have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers and are found in 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas.

This is overcome using CDK4/6 inhibitors. Inhibition of CDK4/6 not only suppresses Rb phosphorylation, but also reduces TSC2 phosphorylation and thus partially attenuates mTORC1 activity. This relieves feedback inhibition of upstream EGFR family kinases, resensitizing tumors to EGFR/HER2 blockade. Consequently, dual inhibition of EGFR/HER2 and CDK4/6 invokes a more potent suppression of TSC2 phosphorylation and hence mTORC1/S6K/S6RP activity. The suppression of both Rb and S6RP enhances G1 arrest and a phenotype resembling cellular senescence. In vivo, CDK4/6 inhibitors sensitize patient-derived xenograft tumors to HER2-targeted therapies and delay tumor recurrence in a transgenic model of HER2-positive breast cancer.;;Somatic mutations and copy number variation in the ERBB family are frequent in urothelial carcinoma (UC) and may represent viable therapeutic targets. We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.;;To identify novel mechanisms of resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors in patients with lung adenocarcinoma that progressed under therapy with either AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models. We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRASG12S mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR/MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

Among them, RET rearrangements represent distinct and potentially druggable targets that are recurrently found in lung adenocarcinomas. We provide further evidence that current anti-RET drugs may not be potent enough to induce durable responses in such tumors. We report that potent inhibitors, such as AD80 or ponatinib, that stably bind in the DFG-out conformation of RET may overcome these limitations and selectively kill RET-rearranged tumors. Using chemical genomics in conjunction with phosphoproteomic analyses in RET-rearranged cells, we identify the CCDC6-RETI788N mutation and drug-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway reactivation as possible mechanisms by which tumors may escape the activity of RET inhibitors. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the druggability of RET kinase fusions that may be of help for the development of effective therapies targeting such tumors.

Here we have characterized tumour cell responses to two new inhibitors of FGFR1-3, AZ12908010 and the clinical candidate AZD4547, making comparisons with the well-characterized FGFR inhibitor PD173074. In a panel of 16 human tumour cell lines, the anti-proliferative activity of AZ12908010 or AZD4547 was strongly linked to the presence of deregulated FGFR signalling, indicating that addiction to deregulated FGFRs provides a therapeutic opportunity for selective intervention. Acquired resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a growing problem in the clinic but has not yet been explored for FGFR inhibitors. To assess how FGFR-dependent tumour cells adapt to long-term FGFR inhibition, we generated a derivative of the KMS-11 myeloma cell line (FGFR(Y373C)) with acquired resistance to AZ12908010 (KMS-11R cells). Basal phosphorylated FGFR and FGFR-dependent downstream signalling were constitutively elevated and refractory to drug in KMS-11R cells. Sequencing of FGFR3 in KMS-11R cells revealed the presence of a heterozygous mutation at the gatekeeper residue, encoding FGFR3(V555M); consistent with this, KMS-11R cells were cross-resistant to AZD4547 and PD173074. These results define the selectivity and efficacy of two new FGFR inhibitors and identify a secondary gatekeeper mutation as a mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors that should be anticipated as clinical evaluation proceeds.

Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	Serrano C. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015;;Garner AP. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

We identify a subset of mouse and human HCCs harboring VEGFA genomic amplification, displaying distinct biologic characteristics. Unlike common tumor amplifications, this one seems to work via heterotypic paracrine interactions; stromal VEGF receptors (VEGFR), responding to tumor VEGF-A, produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that reciprocally affects tumor cells. VEGF-A inhibition results in HGF downregulation and reduced proliferation, specifically in amplicon-positive mouse HCCs. Sorafenib-the first-line drug in advanced HCC-targets multiple kinases, including VEGFRs, but has only an overall mild beneficial effect. We found that VEGFA amplification specifies mouse and human HCCs that are distinctly sensitive to sorafenib. FISH analysis of a retrospective patient cohort showed markedly improved survival of sorafenib-treated patients with VEGFA-amplified HCCs, suggesting that VEGFA amplification is a potential biomarker for HCC response to VEGF-A-blocking drugs. Using a mouse model of inflammation-driven cancer, we identified a subclass of HCC carrying VEGFA amplification, which is particularly sensitive to VEGF-A inhibition. We found that a similar amplification in human HCC identifies patients who favorably responded to sorafenib-the first-line treatment of advanced HCC-which has an overall moderate therapeutic efficacy.

Reports of clonal heterogeneity in this disease challenge the concept of targeted monotherapy, yet a small subset of patients derives extended benefit. Our aim was to analyze such outliers and explore the genomic background of extreme rapalog sensitivity in the context of intratumor heterogeneity. We analyzed archived tumor tissue of 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma, who previously achieved durable disease control with rapalogs (median duration, 28 months). DNA was extracted from spatially separate areas of primary tumors and metastases. Custom target capture and ultradeep sequencing was used to identify alterations across 230 target genes. Whole-exome sequence analysis was added to investigate genes beyond this original target list. Five long-term responders contributed 14 specimens to explore clonal heterogeneity. Genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were detected in 11 of 14 specimens, offering plausible explanation for exceptional treatment response through alterations in two genes (TSC1 and MTOR). In two subjects, distinct yet functionally convergent alterations activated the mTOR pathway in spatially separate sites. In 1 patient, concurrent genomic events occurred in two separate pathway components across different tumor regions. Analysis of outlier cases can facilitate identification of potential biomarkers for targeted agents, and we implicate two genes as candidates for further study in this class of drugs. The previously reported phenomenon of clonal convergence can occur within a targetable pathway which might have implications for biomarker development beyond this disease and this class of agents.

Sanger sequencing of the tyrosine kinome identified mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene in 3.8% of squamous cell lung cancers and cell lines. Squamous lung cancer cell lines harboring DDR2 mutations were selectively killed by knock-down of DDR2 by RNAi or by treatment with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Tumors established from a DDR2 mutant cell line were sensitive to dasatinib in xenograft models. Expression of mutated DDR2 led to cellular transformation which was blocked by dasatinib. A squamous cell lung cancer patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation. These data suggest that gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 are important oncogenic events and are amenable to therapy with dasatinib. As dasatinib is already approved for use, these findings could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. DDR2 mutations are present in 4% of lung SCCs, and DDR2 mutations are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. These findings provide a rationale for designing clinical trials with the FDA-approved drug dasatinib in patients with lung SCCs.	Hammerman PS. et al.,Cancer Discov,2011

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.;;Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are highly responsive to treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;To extend the results of a phase III trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinomas harboring EML4-ALK fusion. We conducted a co-clinical trial in a mouse model comparing the ALK inhibitor crizotinib to the standard-of-care cytotoxic agents docetaxel or pemetrexed. Concordant with the clinical outcome in humans, crizotinib produced a substantially higher response rate compared with chemotherapy, associated with significantly longer progression-free survival. Overall survival was also prolonged in crizotinib- compared with chemotherapy-treated mice. Pemetrexed produced superior overall survival compared with docetaxel, suggesting that this agent may be the preferred chemotherapy in the ALK population. In addition, in the EML4-ALK-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, HSP90 inhibition can overcome both primary and acquired crizotinib resistance. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition, as well as the second-generation ALK inhibitor TAE684, demonstrated activity in newly developed lung adenocarcinoma models driven by crizotinib-insensitive EML4-ALK L1196M or F1174L. Our findings suggest that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in ALK inhibitor-naïve disease and support further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors and second-generation ALK inhibitors in tumors with primary or acquired crizotinib resistance.

Identification of molecular biomarkers that predict benefit could guide clinical development. Fixed primary tissue and whole blood were collected prospectively from patients enrolled on GOG 248. DNA was isolated from macro-dissected tumors and blood; next-generation sequence analysis was performed on a panel of cancer related genes. Associations between clinical outcomes [response rate (RR) 20%; progression-free survival (PFS) median 4.9months] and mutations (PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, KRAS, CTNNB1, AKT1, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, FBXW7) were explored. Sequencing data was obtained from tumors of 55 of the 73 enrolled pts. Mutation rates were consistent with published reports: mutations in PTEN (45%), PIK3CA (29%), PIK3R1 (24%), K-RAS (16%), CTNNB1 (18%) were common and mutations in AKT1 (4%), TSC1 (2%), TSC2 (2%), NF1 (9%) and FBXW7 (4%) were less common. Increased PFS (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.01-0.78) and RR (response difference 0.83; 95% CI 0.03-0.99) were noted for AKT1 mutation. An increase in PFS (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.20-0.97) but not RR (response difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.34-0.34) was identified for CTNNB1 mutation. Both patients with TSC mutations had an objective response.

Mutations in AKT1, TSC1 and TSC2 are rare, but may predict clinical benefit from temsirolimus. CTNNB1 mutations were associated with longer PFS on temsirolimus.	Myers AP. et al.,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.	;;Ohashi K. et al.,Proc.

PIP(3) recruits PDK1 and AKT to the cell membrane through interactions with their pleckstrin homology domains, allowing PDK1 to activate AKT by phosphorylating it at residue threonine-308. We show that total PDK1 protein and mRNA were overexpressed in a majority of human breast cancers and that 21% of tumors had five or more copies of the gene encoding PDK1, PDPK1. We found that increased PDPK1 copy number was associated with upstream pathway lesions (ERBB2 amplification, PTEN loss, or PIK3CA mutation), as well as patient survival. Examination of an independent set of breast cancers and tumor cell lines derived from multiple forms of human cancers also found increased PDK1 protein levels associated with such upstream pathway lesions. In human mammary cells, PDK1 enhanced the ability of upstream lesions to signal to AKT, stimulate cell growth and migration, and rendered cells more resistant to PDK1 and PI3K inhibition. After orthotopic transplantation, PDK1 overexpression was not oncogenic but dramatically enhanced the ability of ERBB2 to form tumors. Our studies argue that PDK1 overexpression and increased PDPK1 copy number are common occurrences in cancer that potentiate the oncogenic effect of upstream lesions on the PI3K pathway. Therefore, we conclude that alteration of PDK1 is a critical component of oncogenic PI3K signaling in breast cancer.	Maurer M. et al.,Cancer Res.,2009

Biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) is a highly penetrant childhood cancer syndrome often resulting in GBM characterized by a high mutational burden. Evidence suggests that high mutation and neoantigen loads are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition. We performed exome sequencing and neoantigen prediction on 37 bMMRD cancers and compared them with childhood and adult brain neoplasms. Neoantigen prediction bMMRD GBM was compared with responsive adult cancers from multiple tissues. Two siblings with recurrent multifocal bMMRD GBM were treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. All malignant tumors (n = 32) were hypermutant. Although bMMRD brain tumors had the highest mutational load because of secondary polymerase mutations (mean, 17,740 ± standard deviation, 7,703), all other high-grade tumors were hypermutant (mean, 1,589 ± standard deviation, 1,043), similar to other cancers that responded favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors. bMMRD GBM had a significantly higher mutational load than sporadic pediatric and adult gliomas and all other brain tumors (P < .001). bMMRD GBM harbored mean neoantigen loads seven to 16 times higher than those in immunoresponsive melanomas, lung cancers, or microsatellite-unstable GI cancers (P < .001). On the basis of these preclinical data, we treated two bMMRD siblings with recurrent multifocal GBM with the anti-programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, which resulted in clinically significant responses and a profound radiologic response. This report of initial and durable responses of recurrent GBM to immune checkpoint inhibition may have implications for GBM in general and other hypermutant cancers arising from primary (genetic predisposition) or secondary MMRD.,,We present the case of a patient with a left frontal glioblastoma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor features and hypermutated genotype in the setting of a POLE germline alteration. During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults. Herein, we provide proof of principle that glioblastomas with DNA-repair defects treated with checkpoint blockade may result in CNS immune activation, leading to clinically and immunologically significant responses. These patients may represent a genomically stratified group for whom immunotherapy could be considered.

However, anti-PD-1 therapy in some patients provides no benefit and/or results in adverse side effects. The factors that determine whether patients will be drug sensitive or resistant are not fully understood; therefore, genomic assessment of exceptional responders can provide important insight into patient response. Here, we identified a patient with endometrial cancer who had an exceptional response to the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Clinical grade targeted genomic profiling of a pretreatment tumor sample from this individual identified a mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) that associated with an ultramutator phenotype. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that the presence of POLE mutation associates with high mutational burden and elevated expression of several immune checkpoint genes. Together, these data suggest that cancers harboring POLE mutations are good candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.;;Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated that microsatellite instability (MSI) or defective mismatch repair (MMR) and high tumor mutational load can predict response to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor inhibitor pembrolizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Mutations in polymerase ε (POLE), a DNA polymerase involved in DNA replication and repair, contribute to an ultramutated but microsatellite stable (MSS) phenotype in colorectal tumors that is uniquely distinct from MSI tumors. This report presents the first case in the literature describing a clinical response to pembrolizumab in an 81-year-old man with treatment-refractory mCRC characterized by an MSS phenotype and POLE mutation identified on genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing.

IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCη, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells.	Ma L. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2014

The two genes are mutated in various human cancers. Such tumors are predicted to be hypersensitive to, yet still depend on, secreted Wnts. We previously showed that mutation of RZ in the intestine yields rapidly growing adenomas containing LGR5(+) (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) stem cells and Wnt3-producing Paneth cells. We now show that removal of Paneth cells by Math1 mutation inhibits RZ(-/-) tumor formation. Similarly, deletion of Wnt3 inhibits tumorigenesis. Treatment of mice carrying RZ(-/-) intestinal neoplasia with a small molecule Wnt secretion inhibitor (porcupine inhibitor C59) strongly inhibited growth, whereas adjacent normal crypts remained intact. These results establish that paracrine Wnt secretion is an essential driver of RZ(-/-) tumor growth and imply that a therapeutic window exists for the use of porcupine inhibitors for RZ-mutant cancers.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.

Hormonal manipulation leads to response in some patients with EC, but resistance derived from PI3K pathway activation has been documented. Targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may overcome endocrine resistance. We conducted a two-institution phase II trial of everolimus and letrozole in women with recurrent EC. Patients were considered incurable, had measurable disease, and were treated with up to two prior cytotoxic regimens. Everolimus was administered orally at 10 mg daily and letrozole was administered orally at 2.5 mg daily. Each cycle consisted of 4 weeks of therapy. Patients were treated until progression, toxicity, or complete response (CR). The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR), which was defined as CR, partial response, or stable disease (≥ 16 weeks) by RECIST 1.0 criteria. Translational studies were performed to correlate biomarkers with response. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (median age, 62 years; range, 24 to 82 years). Thirty-five patients were evaluable for response. The CBR was 40% (14 of 35 patients); the median number of cycles among responders was 15 (range, seven to 29 cycles). The confirmed objective response rate (RR) was 32% (11 of 35 patients; nine CRs and two partial responses; median, 15 cycles; range, eight to 29 cycles). Twenty percent of patients (seven of 35 patients) were taken off treatment after a prolonged CR and at the discretion of the treating clinician. None of the patients discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity. Serous histology was the best predictor of lack of response. Patients with endometrioid histology and CTNNB1 mutations responded well to everolimus and letrozole. Everolimus plus letrozole results in a high CBR and RR in patients with recurrent EC. Further development of this combination in recurrent endometrioid EC is under way.	Slomovitz BM. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015

Although the addition of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to standard cytotoxic therapy has greatly improved upfront treatment, treatment-related morbidity and mortality remain high. TKI monotherapy provides only temporary responses and renders patients susceptible to the development of TKI resistance. Thus, identifying agents that could enhance the activity of TKIs is urgently needed. Recently, a selective inhibitor of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), ABT-199 (venetoclax), has shown impressive activity against hematologic malignancies. We demonstrate that the combination of TKIs with venetoclax is highly synergistic in vitro, decreasing cell viability and inducing apoptosis in Ph(+)ALL. Furthermore, the multikinase inhibitors dasatinib and ponatinib appear to have the added advantage of inducing Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase (LYN)-mediated proapoptotic BCL-2-like protein 11 (BIM) expression and inhibiting up-regulation of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), thereby potentially overcoming the development of venetoclax resistance. Evaluation of the dasatinib-venetoclax combination for the treatment of primary Ph(+)ALL patient samples in xenografted immunodeficient mice confirmed the tolerability of this drug combination and demonstrated its superior antileukemic efficacy compared to either agent alone. These data suggest that the combination of dasatinib and venetoclax has the potential to improve the treatment of Ph(+)ALL and should be further evaluated for patient care.	;;;;;;;;;;Leonard JT. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2016

To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance, we developed and characterized cell lines resistant to ARN-509 and enzalutamide. In a subset of cell lines, ARN-509 and enzalutamide exhibit agonist activity due to a missense mutation (F876L) in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR). AR F876L is sufficient to confer resistance to ARN-509 and enzalutamide in in vitro and in vivo models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Importantly, the AR F876L mutant is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive CRPC. Thus, selective outgrowth of AR F876L is a clinically relevant mechanism of second-generation antiandrogen resistance that can potentially be targeted with next-generation antiandrogens. A missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor F876L confers resistance to the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509 in preclinical models of AR function and prostate cancer and is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive disease. These results chart a new path for the discovery and development of next-generation antiandrogens that could be coupled with a blood-based companion diagnostic to guide treatment decisions.;;Despite the impressive clinical activity of the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509 in patients with prostate cancer, acquired resistance invariably emerges.

The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.;;	Zou HY. et al.,Cancer Res.,2007;;Diamond JR. et al.,J.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

The ATM protein lies at the heart of this signaling network, which is collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). ATM is involved in numerous DDR-regulated cellular responses-cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Disabling mutations in the gene encoding ATM occur frequently in various human tumors, including lung cancer and hematological malignancies. We report that ATM deficiency prevents apoptosis in human and murine cancer cells exposed to genotoxic chemotherapy. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that ATM-defective cells display strong non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit). Further, this dependence of ATM-defective cells on DNA-PKcs offers a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention: We show that pharmacological or genetic abrogation of DNA-PKcs in ATM-defective cells leads to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks and the subsequent CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP)-dependent generation of large single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) repair intermediates. These ssDNA structures trigger proapoptotic signaling through the RPA/ATRIP/ATR/Chk1/p53/Puma axis, ultimately leading to the apoptotic demise of ATM-defective cells exposed to DNA-PKcs inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that DNA-PKcs inhibitors are effective as single agents against ATM-defective lymphomas in vivo. Together, our data implicate DNA-PKcs as a drug target for the treatment of ATM-defective malignancies.;;When the integrity of the genome is threatened, cells activate a complex, kinase-based signaling network to arrest the cell cycle, initiate DNA repair, or, if the extent of damage is beyond repair capacity, induce apoptotic cell death.

This primary DNA damage is converted by mismatch repair into secondary lesions, which block replication and in turn induce DNA double-strand breaks that trigger the DNA damage response (DDR). Key upstream players in the DDR are the phosphoinositide 3-kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR). Here, we addressed the question of the importance of ATM and ATR in the cell death response following temozolomide. We show that (i) ATM- and ATR-mutated cells are hypersensitive to temozolomide, (ii) O(6)-MeG triggers ATM and ATR activation, (iii) knockdown of ATM and ATR enhances cell kill in gliobalstoma and malignant melanoma cells with a stronger and significant effect in ATR knockdown cells, (iv) ATR, but not ATM, knockdown abolished phosphorylation of H2AX, CHK1, and CHK2 in glioma cells, and (v) temozolomide-induced cell death was more prominently enhanced by pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 compared with CHK2. The data suggest that ATM and, even better, ATR inhibition is a useful strategy in sensitizing cancer cells to temozolomide and presumably also other anticancer drugs.;;Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before cystectomy is the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), with 25-50% of patients expected to achieve a pathologic response.

Pretreatment MIBC samples prospectively collected from patients treated in two separate clinical trials of cisplatin-based NAC provided the discovery and validation sets.

The mean number of variants and variant status for each gene were correlated with response. Variant data from the discovery cohort were used to create a classification tree to discriminate responders from nonresponders. The resulting decision rule was then tested in the independent validation set.

Recently, we have demonstrated that transduction of oncogenic HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) and MYC together with HPV16 E6E7 is sufficient for tumorigenic transformation of normal human cervical keratinocytes (HCKs). Here, we show that transduction of HRAS(G12V) on the background of E6E7 expression causes accumulation of MYC protein and tumorigenic transformation of not only normal HCKs but also other normal primary human cells, including tongue keratinocytes and bronchial epithelial cells as well as hTERT-immortalized foreskin fibroblasts. Subcutaneous transplantation of as few as 200 HCKs expressing E6E7 and HRAS(G12V) resulted in tumor formation within 2 months. Dissecting RAS signaling pathways, constitutively active forms of AKT1 or MEK1 did not result in tumor formation with E6E7, but tumorigenic transformation was induced with addition of MYC. Increased MYC expression endowed resistance to calcium- and serum-induced terminal differentiation and activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. An mTOR inhibitor (Rapamycin) and MYC inhibition a level not affecting proliferation in culture both markedly suppressed tumor formation by HCKs expressing E6E7 and HRAS(G12V). These results suggest that a single mutation of HRAS could be oncogenic in the background of deregulated expression of E6E7 and MYC plays a critical role in cooperation with the RAS signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Thus inhibition of MYC and/or the downstream mTOR pathway could be a therapeutic strategy not only for the MYC-altered but also RAS-activated cancers.;;In hematological malignancies, constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is frequently observed, conveys a poor prognosis, and constitutes a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we investigated the molecular and functional effects of pharmacological MEK inhibition in cell line models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and freshly isolated primary AML samples. The small-molecule, ATP-non-competitive, MEK inhibitor PD0325901 markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation and growth of several AML cell lines and approximately 70 % of primary AML samples. Growth inhibition was due to G(1)-phase arrest and induction of apoptosis. Transformation by constitutively active upstream pathway elements (HRAS, RAF-1, and MEK) rendered FDC-P1 cells exquisitely prone to PD0325901-induced apoptosis. Gene and protein expression profiling revealed a selective effect of PD0325901 on ERK phosphorylation and compensatory upregulation of the RAF/MEK and AKT/p70(                            S6K                         ) kinase modules, potentially mediating resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition. Consequently, in appropriate cellular contexts, both \"vertical\" (i.e., inhibition of RAF and MEK along the MAPK pathway) and \"lateral\" (i.e., simultaneous inhibition of the MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways) combination strategies may result in synergistic anti-leukemic effects. Overall, MEK inhibition exerts potent growth inhibitory and proapoptotic activity in preclinical models of AML, particularly in combination with other pathway inhibitors. Deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of MEK inhibitors will likely translate into more effective targeted strategies for the treatment of AML.,,"	;;;;;;Narisawa-Saito M. et al.,Carcinogenesis,2012;;Ricciardi MR. et al.,J.

The degree to which all recurrent mutants can drive estrogen-independent activities and reduced sensitivity to ER antagonists like fulvestrant is not established. In this report, we characterize the spectrum of ESR1 mutations from more than 900 patients. ESR1 mutations were detected in 10%, with D538G being the most frequent (36%), followed by Y537S (14%). Several novel, activating mutations were also detected (e.g., L469V, V422del, and Y537D). Although many mutations lead to constitutive activity and reduced sensitivity to ER antagonists, only select mutants such as Y537S caused a magnitude of change associated with fulvestrant resistance in vivo Correspondingly, tumors driven by Y537S, but not D5358G, E380Q, or S463P, were less effectively inhibited by fulvestrant than more potent and bioavailable antagonists, including AZD9496. These data point to a need for antagonists with optimal pharmacokinetic properties to realize clinical efficacy against certain ESR1 mutants.Significance: A diversity of activating ESR1 mutations exist, only some of which confer resistance to existing ER antagonists that might be overcome by next-generation inhibitors such as AZD9496.

METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 (BRIM-2), patients received oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice per day). Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, cell-cycle progression, and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing, or somatic mutation profiling. Results Vemurafenib inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression. An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies (n = 22; P = .013). Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response. Baseline mutations in MEK1(P124) coexisting with BRAF(V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary NRAS(Q61) mutations or MEK1(Q56P) or MEK1(E203K) mutations. These two activating MEK1 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors. CONCLUSION Vemurafenib inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic BRAF signaling through the MAPK pathway. Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS and MEK1 in subsets of patients. The data suggest that inhibition downstream of BRAF should help to overcome acquired resistance.	Trunzer K. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013

We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of imatinib in metastatic mucosal, acral, or chronically sun-damaged (CSD) melanoma with KIT amplifications and/or mutations. Patients received imatinib 400 mg once per day or 400 mg twice per day if there was no initial response. Dose reductions were permitted for treatment-related toxicities. Additional oncogene mutation screening was performed by mass spectroscopy. Twenty-five patients were enrolled (24 evaluable). Eight patients (33%) had tumors with KIT mutations, 11 (46%) with KIT amplifications, and five (21%) with both. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 3.7 to 27.1 months). Best overall response rate (BORR) was 29% (21% excluding nonconfirmed responses) with a two-stage 95% CI of 13% to 51%. BORR was significantly greater than the hypothesized null of 5% and statistically significantly different by mutation status (7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only). There were no statistical differences in rates of progression or survival by mutation status or by melanoma site. The overall disease control rate was 50% but varied significantly by KIT mutation status (77% mutated v 18% amplified). Four patients harbored pretreatment NRAS mutations, and one patient acquired increased KIT amplification after treatment. Melanomas that arise on mucosal, acral, or CSD skin should be assessed for KIT mutations. Imatinib can be effective when tumors harbor KIT mutations, but not if KIT is amplified only. NRAS mutations and KIT copy number gain may be mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to imatinib.;;Although durable responses can be achieved with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib in melanomas harboring KIT mutations, the efficacy of alternative inhibitors after progression to imatinib and the activity of these agents on brain metastases are unknown. We conducted a phase II study of nilotinib 400 mg twice a day in two cohorts of patients with melanomas harboring KIT mutations or amplification: (A) those refractory or intolerant to a prior KIT inhibitor; and (B) those with brain metastases. The primary endpoint was 4-month disease control rate. Secondary endpoints included response rate, time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). A Simon two-stage and a single-stage design was planned to assess for the primary endpoint in cohorts A and B, respectively. Twenty patients were enrolled and 19 treated (11 in cohort A; 8 in cohort B). Three patients on cohort A [27%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 8%-56%] and 1 on cohort B (12.5%; 90% CI, 0.6%-47%) achieved the primary endpoint. Two partial responses were observed in cohort A (18.2%; 90% CI, 3%-47%); none were observed in cohort B. The median TTP and OS was 3.3 (90% CI, 2.1-3.9 months) and 9.1 months (90% CI, 4.3-14.2 months), respectively, in all treated patients. Nilotinib may achieve disease control in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations and whose disease progressed after imatinib therapy. The efficacy of this agent in KIT-altered melanoma with brain metastasis is limited.	Hodi FS. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013;;Carvajal RD. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015

This primary DNA damage is converted by mismatch repair into secondary lesions, which block replication and in turn induce DNA double-strand breaks that trigger the DNA damage response (DDR). Key upstream players in the DDR are the phosphoinositide 3-kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR). Here, we addressed the question of the importance of ATM and ATR in the cell death response following temozolomide. We show that (i) ATM- and ATR-mutated cells are hypersensitive to temozolomide, (ii) O(6)-MeG triggers ATM and ATR activation, (iii) knockdown of ATM and ATR enhances cell kill in gliobalstoma and malignant melanoma cells with a stronger and significant effect in ATR knockdown cells, (iv) ATR, but not ATM, knockdown abolished phosphorylation of H2AX, CHK1, and CHK2 in glioma cells, and (v) temozolomide-induced cell death was more prominently enhanced by pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 compared with CHK2. The data suggest that ATM and, even better, ATR inhibition is a useful strategy in sensitizing cancer cells to temozolomide and presumably also other anticancer drugs.

Patients with disseminated small-cell cancers have a particularly unfavorable prognosis, with most succumbing to their disease within two years. Here, we report on the genetic and functional analysis of an outlier curative response of a patient with metastatic small-cell cancer to combined checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibition and DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a clonal hemizygous mutation in the Mre11 complex gene RAD50 that attenuated ATM signaling which in the context of CHK1 inhibition contributed, via synthetic lethality, to extreme sensitivity to irinotecan. As Mre11 mutations occur in a diversity of human tumors, the results suggest a tumor-specific combination therapy strategy in which checkpoint inhibition in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy is synthetically lethal in tumor cells but not normal cells with somatic mutations that impair Mre11 complex function. Strategies to effect deep and lasting responses to cancer therapy in patients with metastatic disease have remained difficult to attain, especially in early-phase clinical trials. Here, we present an in-depth genomic and functional genetic analysis identifying RAD50 hypomorphism as a contributing factor to a curative response to systemic combination therapy in a patient with recurrent, metastatic small-cell cancer.

Among the transcripts with high correlation between DNA and RNA, we identified SYK, a tyrosine kinase involved in B-cell receptor signalling. SYK was amplified at DNA level, as validated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis, and overexpressed at both RNA and protein levels in the JeKo-1 cell line. Low-level amplification, with protein overexpression of Syk was demonstrated by FISH in a small subset of clinical samples. After treatment with low doses of the Syk inhibitor piceatannol, cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis were induced in the cell line overexpressing Syk, while cells expressing low levels of Syk were much less sensitive. A combination of genomic and expression profiling suggested Syk inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy to be explored in lymphomas.,,B-cell receptor signaling contributes to apoptosis resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), limiting the efficacy of current therapeutic approaches. In this study, we investigated the expression of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, in CLL and its role in apoptosis. Gene expression profiling identified enhanced expression of SYK and downstream pathways in CLL compared with healthy B cells. Immunoblotting showed increased expression and phosphorylation of SYK, PLCgamma(2), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 in CLL compared with healthy B cells, suggesting enhanced activation of these mediators in CLL. SYK inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of SYK downstream targets and induced apoptosis in primary CLL cells. With respect to prognostic factors, SYK inhibitors exerted stronger cytotoxic effects in unmutated and ZAP70(+) cases. Cytotoxic effects of SYK inhibitors also associated with SYK protein expression, potentially predicting response to therapy. Combination of fludarabine with SYK Inhibitor II or R406 increased cytotoxicity compared with fludarabine therapy alone. We observed no stroma-contact-mediated drug resistance for SYK inhibitors as described for fludarabine treatment. CD40 ligation further enhanced efficacy of SYK inhibition. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the recently observed therapeutic effects of the SYK inhibitor R406 in CLL. Combination of SYK inhibitors with fludarabine might be a novel treatment option particularly for CLL patients with poor prognosis and should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.	Bresler SC. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2011

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

Deregulation of cell cycle kinases, e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can initiate a hyper-proliferative cell phenotype and cause genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation. Pharmacological agents targeting CDKs have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents for over 20 years, evolving from early pan-CDK inhibitors to second-generation inhibitors with much greater specificity and selectivity. Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful preclinical investigations, CDK inhibitors have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical trials. In addition, inhibitors of other cell cycle kinases are currently progressing through clinical trials. Recent biochemical and genetic studies might be used to improve the effectiveness of cell cycle kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer agents through better drug design, therapeutic combinations, and patient selection.,,Although malignant astrocytomas are a leading cause of cancer-related death in children, rational therapeutic strategies are lacking. We previously identified activating mutations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) (BRAF(T1799A) encoding BRAF(V600E)) in association with homozygous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, encoding p14ARF and p16Ink4a) deletions in pediatric infiltrative astrocytomas. Here we report that BRAF(V600E) expression in neural progenitors (NPs) is insufficient for tumorigenesis and increases NP cellular differentiation as well as apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytomas are readily generated from NPs with additional Ink4a-Arf deletion. The BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 significantly increased survival of mice after intracranial transplant of genetically relevant murine or human astrocytoma cells. Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy. Our findings indicate a rational therapeutic strategy for treating a subset of pediatric astrocytomas with BRAF(V600E) mutation and CDKN2A deficiency.,,Deregulation of the p16(INK4a)-Cdk4/6-Rb pathway is commonly detected in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is a rational therapeutic target. Here, we characterized the p16(INK4a)-Cdk4/6-Rb pathway in the Mayo panel of GBM xenografts, established from primary tissue samples from patients with GBM, and evaluated their response to PD0332991, a specific inhibitor of Cdk4/6. All GBM xenograft lines evaluated in this study had disruptions in the p16(INK4a)-Cdk4/6-Rb pathway. In vitro evaluation using short-term explant cultures from selected GBM xenograft lines showed that PD0332991 effectively arrested cell cycle in G1-phase and inhibited cell proliferation dose-dependently in lines deleted for CDKN2A/B-p16(INK4a) and either single-copy deletion of CDK4 (GBM22), high-level CDK6 amplification (GBM34), or deletion of CDKN2C/p18(INK4c) (GBM43). In contrast, 2 GBM lines with p16(INK4a) expression and either CDK4 amplification (GBM5) or RB mutation (GBM28) were completely resistant to PD0332991. Additional xenograft lines were screened, and GBM63 was identified to have p16(INK4a) expression and CDK4 amplification. Similar to the results with GBM5, GBM63 was resistant to PD0332991 treatment. In an orthotopic survival model, treatment of GBM6 xenografts (CDKN2A/B-deleted and CDK4 wild-type) with PD0332991 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation and prolonged survival.

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.	Bresler SC. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2011

Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab. Two of ten subjects studied here with disease progression after cetuximab treatment acquired this mutation. A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.,,Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibodies represents a clinical challenge in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors such as metastatic colorectal cancer, but its molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. We scanned KRAS exon 2/3/4, NRAS exon 2/3/4 and the overlapping epitopes of the EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for mutations in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue of 21 patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated with chemotherapy +/- EGFR antibodies by next-generation sequencing (\"tumor tissue\" cohort). We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring EGFR-targeted therapies. ,,Patients with colorectal cancer who respond to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab often develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. To design new lines of treatment, the molecular landscape of resistant tumors must be ascertained. We investigated the role of mutations in the EGFR signaling axis on the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab in patients and cellular models. Tissue samples were obtained from 37 patients with colorectal cancer who became refractory to cetuximab. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance. The genetic profile of tumor specimens obtained after cetuximab treatment revealed the emergence of a complex pattern of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes, including two novel EGFR ectodomain mutations (R451C and K467T). Mutational profiling of cetuximab-resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR alleles: S464L, G465R, and I491M. Structurally, these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for the R451C mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab. Colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signaling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding. Both mechanisms of resistance may occur concomitantly. Our data have implications for designing additional lines of therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who relapse upon treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.,,Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--cetuximab and panitumumab--are widely used to treat colorectal cancer.

However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy. Sym004 is an active drug in MCRC resistant to cetuximab/panitumumab mediated by EGFR mutations.

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

Ibrutinib at a daily dose of 420 mg was administered orally until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic effects. After the patients received ibrutinib, median serum IgM levels decreased from 3520 mg per deciliter to 880 mg per deciliter, median hemoglobin levels increased from 10.5 g per deciliter to 13.8 g per deciliter, and bone marrow involvement decreased from 60% to 25% (P<0.01 for all comparisons). The median time to at least a minor response was 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 90.5%, and the major response rate was 73.0%; these rates were highest among patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WT) (with WT indicating wild-type) (100% overall response rate and 91.2% major response rate), followed by patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WHIM) (85.7% and 61.9%, respectively) and patients with MYD88(WT)CXCR4(WT) (71.4% and 28.6%).

Treatment-related toxic effects of grade 2 or higher included neutropenia (in 22% of the patients) and thrombocytopenia (in 14%), which were more common in heavily pretreated patients; postprocedural bleeding (in 3%); epistaxis associated with the use of fish-oil supplements (in 3%); and atrial fibrillation associated with a history of arrhythmia (5%). Ibrutinib was highly active, associated with durable responses, and safe in pretreated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status affected responses to this drug.

From an IMA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%) with KRAS mutations and 34 cases without (38%), we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutations. We used the sequencing data to identify gene fusions, and then performed functional analyses of the fusion gene products. We identified oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET. NRG1 fusions were present in 17.6% (6/34) of KRAS-negative IMAs. The CD74-NRG1 fusion activated HER2:HER3 signaling, whereas the EZR-ERBB4 and TRIM24-BRAF fusions constitutively activated the ERBB4 and BRAF kinases, respectively. Signaling pathway activation and fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth/tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells expressing these fusions were suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for clinical use. Oncogenic fusions act as driver mutations in IMAs without KRAS mutations, and thus represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of such IMAs.	;;Nakaoku T. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis.

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.,,Test the hypothesis that in BRAF-mutated melanomas, clinical responses to selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, will be restricted to tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. We conducted a phase II trial in patients with melanoma whose tumors harbored a BRAF mutation. Patients were stratified by phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low) and treated with selumetinib 75 mg per os twice daily. Pretreatment tumors were also analyzed for genetic changes in 230 genes of interest using an exon-capture approach. The high pAKT cohort was closed after no responses were seen in the first 10 patients. The incidence of low pAKT melanoma tumors was low (∼25% of melanomas tested) and this cohort was eventually closed because of poor accrual. However, among the five patients with melanoma accrued in the low pAKT cohort, there was one partial response (PR). Two other patients had near PRs before undergoing surgical resection of residual disease (one patient) or discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity (one patient). Among the two nonresponding, low pAKT patients with melanoma, co-mutations in MAP2K1, NF1, and/or EGFR were detected. Tumor regression was seen in three of five patients with BRAF-mutated, low pAKT melanomas; no responses were seen in the high pAKT cohort. These results provide rationale for co-targeting MEK and PI3K/AKT in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma whose tumors express high pAKT. However, the complexity of genetic changes in melanoma indicates that additional genetic information will be needed for optimal selection of patients likely to respond to MEK inhibitors.,,A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to targeted anticancer agents should speed the development of treatment strategies with lasting clinical efficacy. RAF inhibition in BRAF-mutant melanoma exemplifies the promise and challenge of many targeted drugs; although response rates are high, resistance invariably develops. Here, we articulate overarching principles of resistance to kinase inhibitors, as well as a translational approach to characterize resistance in the clinical setting through tumor mutation profiling. As a proof of principle, we performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 138 cancer genes in a tumor obtained from a patient with melanoma who developed resistance to PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response. The resulting profile identified an activating mutation at codon 121 in the downstream kinase MEK1 that was absent in the corresponding pretreatment tumor. The MEK1(C121S) mutation was shown to increase kinase activity and confer robust resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition in vitro. Thus, MEK1(C121S) or functionally similar mutations are predicted to confer resistance to combined MEK/RAF inhibition. These results provide an instructive framework for assessing mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition and illustrate the use of emerging technologies in a manner that may accelerate personalized cancer medicine.

Dysregulation of PDGFRA has been reported in many cancers. However, PDGFRA mutations in melanomas have not been well studied. We analyzed the genetic mutations of PDGFRA in Chinese patients with melanoma and determined the inhibitory potency of TKIs, such as imatinib and crenolanib, on mutant PDGFRA. Of note, 351 melanoma tissue samples were examined for genetic mutations in exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA. Activities of mutations in response to imatinib and crenolanib were analyzed by Western blotting of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFRA and cell proliferation assays. PDGFRA mutations were observed in 4.6% (16 of 351) of melanomas, and these mutations were mainly detected in acral and mucosal melanomas. PDGFRA mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with KIT mutations, but may coexist with BRAF and NRAS mutations. The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA. Except that V658A mutation was imatinib-resistant, all the other mutations were sensitive to both imatinib and crenolanib. PDGFRA mutations are detected in a small population of melanoma patients. Our study suggests that patients with melanoma harboring certain PDGFRA mutations may benefit from imatinib and crenolanib treatment.;;Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) is a target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based targeted therapy.

EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.,,Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

We investigated the potential antitumor activity of NVP-BEZ235, which is a novel dual PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in gliomas. The compound suppressed glioma cell proliferation with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range by specifically inhibiting the activity of target proteins including Akt, S6K1, S6, and 4EBP1 in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. NVP-BEZ235 treatment of glioma cell lines led to G(1) cell cycle arrest and induced autophagy. Furthermore, expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important angiogenic modulator in glioma cells, was significantly decreased, suggesting that NVP-BEZ235 may also exert an antiangiogenic effect. Preclinical testing of the therapeutic efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 showed that it significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing animals without causing any obvious toxicity. Tumor extracts harvested from animals after treatment showed that the compound inhibited the activity of target proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade. Immunohistochemical analyses also showed a significant reduction in staining for VEGF von Willebrand factor (factor VIII) in NVP-BEZ235-treated tumor sections compared with controls, further confirming that NVP-BEZ235 has an antiangiogenic effect in vivo. We conclude from these findings that NVP-BEZ235 antagonizes PI3K and mTOR signaling and induces cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of VEGF, and autophagy. These results warrant further development of NVP-BEZ235 for clinical trials for human gliomas or other advanced cancers with altered PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.,,The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is widely postulated to be an effective therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. The aim of the study was to test the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor MK2206 for thyroid cancer. We examined the effects of MK2206 on thyroid cancer cells with respect to the genotypes of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Proliferation of thyroid cancer cells OCUT1, K1, FTC133, C643, Hth7, and TPC1, which harbored PIK3CA, PTEN, Ras, or RET/PTC mutations that could activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, was potently inhibited by MK2206 with IC(50) values mostly below or around 0.5 μm. In contrast, no potent inhibition by MK2206 was seen in most of the Hth74, KAT18, SW1736, WRO, and TAD2 cells that did not harbor mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. The inhibition efficacy was also genetic-selective. Specifically, the average inhibition efficacies were 59.2 ± 11.3 vs. 36.4 ± 8.8% (P = 0.005) at 1 μm MK2206 and 64.4 ± 11.5 vs. 38.5 ± 18.9% (P = 0.02) at 3 μm MK2206 for cells with mutations vs. cells without. The SW1736 cell, lacking mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, had minimal response to MK2206, but transfection with exogenous PIK3CA mutants, PIK3CA H1047R and E545K, significantly increased its sensitivity to MK2206. MK2206 also completely overcame the feedback activation of Akt from temsirolimus-induced mammalian target of rapamycin suppression, and the two inhibitors synergistically inhibited thyroid cancer cell growth. Our study demonstrates a genetic selectivity of MK2206 in inhibiting thyroid cancer cells by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, supporting a clinical trial in thyroid cancer.;;Mutations of the PIK3CA gene may predict response to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Concomitant mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway may mediate resistance. Tumors from patients with breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Program) were analyzed for PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations. Patients with PIK3CA mutations were treated, whenever feasible, with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Of 140 patients analyzed, 25 (18%) had PIK3CA mutations, including five of 14 patients with squamous cell cervical, seven of 29 patients with endometrial, six of 29 patients with breast, and seven of 60 patients with ovarian cancers. Of the 25 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 23 (median of two prior therapies) were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor. Two (9%) of 23 patients had stable disease for more than 6 months, and seven patients (30%) had a partial response. In comparison, only seven (10%) of 70 patients with the same disease types but with wild-type PIK3CA treated on the same protocols responded (P = .04). Seven patients (30%) with PIK3CA mutations had coexisting MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations (ovarian cancer, n = 5; endometrial cancer, n = 2), and two of these patients (ovarian cancer) achieved a response. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 18% of tested patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors demonstrated a higher response rate than patients without mutations. A subset of patients with ovarian cancer with simultaneous PIK3CA and MAPK mutations responded to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, suggesting that not all patients demonstrate resistance when the MAPK pathway is concomitantly activated.,,To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of copanlisib, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Phase I dose-escalation study including patients with advanced solid tumors or NHL, and a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients received three weekly intravenous infusions of copanlisib per 28-day cycle over the dose range 0.1-1.2 mg/kg. Plasma copanlisib levels were analyzed for pharmacokinetics. Biomarker analysis included PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF, and PTEN mutational status and PTEN immunohistochemistry. Whole-body [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) was carried out at baseline and following the first dose to assess early pharmacodynamic effects. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were evaluated serially. Fifty-seven patients received treatment. The MTD was 0.8 mg/kg copanlisib. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were nausea and transient hyperglycemia. Copanlisib exposure was dose-proportional with no accumulation; peak exposure positively correlated with transient hyperglycemia post-infusion. Sixteen of 20 patients treated at the MTD had reduced (18)FDG-PET uptake; 7 (33%) had a reduction >25%. One patient achieved a complete response (CR; endometrial carcinoma exhibiting both PIK3CA and PTEN mutations and complete PTEN loss) and two had a partial response (PR; both metastatic breast cancer). Among the nine NHL patients, all six with follicular lymphoma (FL) responded (one CR and five PRs) and one patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had a PR by investigator assessment; two patients with FL who achieved CR (per post hoc independent radiologic review) were on treatment >3 years. Copanlisib, dosed intermittently on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, was well tolerated and the MTD was determined to be 0.8 mg/kg. Copanlisib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and promising anti-tumor activity, particularly in patients with NHL. NCT00962611; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00962611.,,,,This phase I dose-escalation study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of CH5132799. Patients with metastatic solid tumors were eligible for the study. CH5132799 was administered orally once daily or twice daily in 28-day cycles. Thirty-eight patients with solid tumors received CH5132799 at 2 to 96 mg once daily or 48 to 72 mg twice daily. The MTD was 48 mg on the twice-daily schedule but was not reached on the once daily schedule. DLTs were grade 3 elevated liver function tests (LFT), grade 3 fatigue, grade 3 encephalopathy, grade 3 diarrhea, and grade 3 diarrhea with grade 3 stomatitis; all DLTs were reversible. Most drug-related adverse events were grade 1/2. Diarrhea (34%) and nausea (32%) were the most common events. Mean Cmax and AUC0-24 in steady state at MTD were 175 ng/mL and 1,550 ng·h/mL, respectively, consistent with efficacious exposure based on preclinical modeling. Reduction in SUVmax with [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was observed in 5 of 7 patients at MTD. A patient with PIK3CA-mutated clear cell carcinoma of the ovary achieved a partial response by GCIG CA125 criteria and further, a heavily pretreated patient with triple-negative breast cancer had marked improvement in her cutaneous skin lesions lasting six cycles. CH5132799 is well tolerated at the MTD dose of 48 mg twice daily. At this dose, the drug had a favorable PK and PD profile and preliminary evidence of clinical activity.,,,,;;Class 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in cell proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. Here, we investigated biomarker strategies for PI3K pathway inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Molecular profiling for candidate PI3K predictive biomarkers was conducted on a collection of NSCLC tumor samples. Assays included comparative genomic hybridization, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction gene expression, mutation detection for PIK3CA and other oncogenes, PTEN immunohistochemistry, and FISH for PIK3CA copy number. In addition, a panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized for alterations in the PI3K pathway was screened with PI3K and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to assess the preclinical predictive value of candidate biomarkers. PIK3CA amplification was detected in 37% of squamous tumors and 5% of adenocarcinomas, whereas PIK3CA mutations were found in 9% of squamous and 0% of adenocarcinomas. Total loss of PTEN immunostaining was found in 21% of squamous tumors and 4% of adenocarcinomas. Cell lines harboring pathway alterations (receptor tyrosine kinase activation, PI3K mutation or amplification, and PTEN loss) were exquisitely sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor had broader activity across the cell line panel and in tumor xenografts. The combination of GDC-0941 with paclitaxel, erlotinib, or a mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor had greater effects on cell viability than PI3K inhibition alone. Candidate biomarkers for PI3K inhibitors have predictive value in preclinical models and show histology-specific alterations in primary tumors, suggesting that distinct biomarker strategies may be required in squamous compared with nonsquamous NSCLC patient populations.,,Colorectal cancer (CRC) with mutational activation of KRAS is observed frequently. In addition, PIK3CA mutations commonly coexist with KRAS mutations and lead to additive activation of the PI3K/MTOR signaling pathway. Here, we investigated how CRC cells that harbor KRAS and PIK3CA mutations affect sensitivity to inhibition of PI3K/MTOR with NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235). We selected CRC patient samples and assessed their mutational status. CRC patients with KRAS or PIK3CA mutations show activation of AKT and MTOR, particularly when KRAS and PIK3CA mutations coexist. Suppression of PI3K/MTOR by BEZ235 results in a growth inhibitory effect and enhanced apoptosis via BIM activation in KRAS mutant cells. Mutational activation of KRAS when accompanied by a PIK3CA mutation converges at PI3K/MTOR pathway activation, resulting in resistance to BEZ235. BIM knockdown blocked the apoptotic response to BEZ235 in KRAS mutant cells, suggesting that PI3K inhibition leads to BIM accumulation. Moreover, BEZ235 treatment resulted in induction of FOXO3A activity and its induced transcription of BIM activation, which sensitized cells to cytotoxic agents leading to apoptosis in double mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting PI3K/MTOR sensitizes cells to apoptosis, implying that activation of PI3K/MTOR signaling via KRAS or PIK3CA mutation is an important pathway in CRC cell growth. Based on these results, coexistent KRAS and PIK3CA mutations confer resistance to BEZ235 via suppression of BIM-induced apoptosis, suggesting that combined treatment with conventional chemoagents is a potential strategy in the clinic.,,Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies. We assessed the effects of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from RAS/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic CRCs (mCRC). Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%). Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%). The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%). Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original tumor and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment. The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients. However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses.;;;;This first-in-human phase I trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual inhibitor of class I PI3K, and mTOR kinases. Once-daily oral apitolisib was administered to patients with solid tumors for days 1 to 21 or 1 to 28 of 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed. Overall, 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70 mg. The commonest ≥G3 toxicities related to apitolisib at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 40 mg once daily included hyperglycemia (18%), rash (14%), liver dysfunction (12%), diarrhea (10%), pneumonitis (8%), mucosal inflammation (6%), and fatigue (4%). Dose-limiting toxicities (1 patient each) were G4 fasting hyperglycemia at 40 mg (21/28 schedule) and G3 maculopapular rash and G3 fasting hyperglycemia at 70 mg (21/28 schedule). The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional. Phosphorylated serine-473 AKT levels were suppressed by ≥90% in platelet-rich plasma within 4 hours at the MTD (50 mg). Pharmacodynamic decreases in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake of >25% occurred in 66% (21/32) of patients dosed at 40 mg once daily. Evidence of single-agent activity included 10 RECIST partial responses (PR; confirmed for peritoneal mesothelioma, PIK3CA mutant head-and-neck cancer, and three pleural mesotheliomas). Apitolisib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with target modulation at doses ≥16 mg. The RP2D was 40 mg once-daily 28/28 schedule; severe on-target toxicities were apparent at ≥40 mg, particularly pneumonitis. Apitolisib was reasonably tolerated at 30 mg, the selected dose for pleural mesothelioma patients given limited respiratory reserve. Modest but durable antitumor activity was demonstrated.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of NGS in the routine care of patients with HNSCC and to correlate genomic alterations with clinical outcomes. Single-center study examining targeted NGS platform used to sequence tumor DNA obtained from 213 HNSCC patients evaluated in outpatient head and neck oncology clinic between August 2011 and December 2014. We correlated tumor genomic profiling results with clinical outcomes. PI3K/RTK pathway activation occurred frequently [activating PIK3CA mutation or amplification (13%), PTEN inactivation (3%), RAS activation (6%), EGFR or ERBB2 activation (9%)]. Alterations in pathways affecting cell-cycle regulation [CCND1 amplification (9%), CDKN2A inactivation (17%), BRCA2 inactivation (2%)] and squamous differentiation [NOTCH1 inactivation (8%) andEP300 inactivation (6%)] were identified. PIK3CA amplification (n = 43), not PIK3CA mutation, was associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0006). Oncogenic RAS mutations (n = 13) were associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0001) and lower overall survival (P = 0.003). Eight patients with advanced, treatment-refractory HNSCC enrolled on clinical trials matched to tumor profiling results, and 50% achieved a partial response. Incorporation of NGS clinical assays into the routine care of patients with HNSCC is feasible and may readily facilitate enrollment into clinical trials of targeted therapy with a higher likelihood of success. Data can be utilized for discovery of genomic biomarkers of outcome. PIK3CA amplification and RAS mutations were frequently identified and associated with poorer prognosis in this cohort.

Thirty-four patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were treated (phase I study, modified 3+3 dose escalation; 5 cohorts; 3-16 mg taselisib once-daily capsule). Taselisib pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional; mean half-life was 40 hours. Frequent dose-dependent, treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea, hyperglycemia, decreased appetite, nausea, rash, stomatitis, and vomiting. At 12 and 16 mg dose levels, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed, with an accumulation of higher-grade adverse events after the cycle 1 DLT assessment window. Pharmacodynamic findings showed pathway inhibition at ≥3 mg in patient tumor samples, consistent with preclinical PIK3CA-mutant tumor xenograft models. Confirmed response rate was 36% for PIK3CA-mutant tumor patients with measurable disease [5/14: 4 breast cancer (3 patients at 12 mg); 1 non-small cell lung cancer], where responses started at 3 mg, and 0% in patients with tumors without known PIK3CA hotspot mutations (0/15).Significance: Preliminary data consistent with preclinical data indicate increased antitumor activity of taselisib in patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors (in comparison with patients with tumors without known activating PIK3CA hotspot mutations) starting at the lowest dose tested of 3 mg, thereby supporting higher potency for taselisib against PIK3CA-mutant tumors.

Here, we show that somatic mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) tyrosine kinase gene, FGFR2, are present in 12% of endometrial carcinomas, with additional instances found in lung squamous cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma. These FGFR2 mutations, many of which are identical to mutations associated with congenital craniofacial developmental disorders, are constitutively activated and oncogenic when ectopically expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Inhibition of FGFR2 kinase activity in endometrial carcinoma cell lines bearing such FGFR2 mutations inhibits transformation and survival, implicating FGFR2 as a novel therapeutic target in endometrial carcinoma.,,Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family of kinases (FGFR1-4) are dysregulated in multiple cancers. Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against BCR-ABL. Ponatinib has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs, prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express activated FGFR1-4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells. In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, gastric, breast, lung, and colon) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) (concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10-30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined. Importantly, the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in BCR-ABL-driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for FGFR1-4 inhibition can be sustained in patients. These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers.,,Patient stratification biomarkers that enable the translation of cancer genetic knowledge into clinical use are essential for the successful and rapid development of emerging targeted anticancer therapeutics. Here, we describe the identification of patient stratification biomarkers for NVP-BGJ398, a novel and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor. By intersecting genome-wide gene expression and genomic alteration data with cell line-sensitivity data across an annotated collection of cancer cell lines called the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we show that genetic alterations for FGFR family members predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398. For the first time, we report oncogenic FGFR1 amplification in osteosarcoma as a potential patient selection biomarker. Furthermore, we show that cancer cell lines harboring FGF19 copy number gain at the 11q13 amplicon are sensitive to NVP-BGJ398 only when concomitant expression of β-klotho occurs. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors in selected patients with cancer harboring tumors with the identified predictors of sensitivity. The success of a personalized medicine approach using targeted therapies ultimately depends on being able to identify the patients who will benefit the most from any given drug. To this end, we have integrated the molecular profiles for more than 500 cancer cell lines with sensitivity data for the novel anticancer drug NVP-BGJ398 and showed that FGFR genetic alterations are the most significant predictors for sensitivity. This work has ultimately endorsed the incorporation of specific patient selection biomakers in the clinical trials for NVP-BGJ398.	Dutt A. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

Studies suggest that retinoblastomas, which initiate with mutations in the gene retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), bypass the p53 pathway because they arise from intrinsically death-resistant cells during retinal development. In contrast to this prevailing theory, here we show that the tumour surveillance pathway mediated by Arf, MDM2, MDMX and p53 is activated after loss of RB1 during retinogenesis. RB1-deficient retinoblasts undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and exit the cell cycle. Subsequently, amplification of the MDMX gene and increased expression of MDMX protein are strongly selected for during tumour progression as a mechanism to suppress the p53 response in RB1-deficient retinal cells. Our data provide evidence that the p53 pathway is inactivated in retinoblastoma and that this cancer does not originate from intrinsically death-resistant cells as previously thought. In addition, they support the idea that MDMX is a specific chemotherapeutic target for treating retinoblastoma.,,Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the retina that begins in utero and is diagnosed in the first years of life. The goals of retinoblastoma treatment are ocular salvage, vision preservation, and reduction of short- and long-term side effects without risking mortality because of tumor dissemination. To identify better chemotherapeutic combinations for the treatment of retinoblastoma, several groups have developed genetic mouse models and orthotopic xenograft models of human retinoblastoma for preclinical testing. Previous studies have implicated the MDMX protein in the suppression of the p53 pathway in retinoblastoma and shown that the MDM2/MDMX antagonist, Nutlin-3a, can efficiently induce p53-mediated cell death in retinoblastoma cell lines. However, Nutlin-3a cannot be administered systemically to treat retinoblastoma, because it has poor penetration across the blood-ocular barrier. Therefore, we developed an ocular formulation of Nutlin-3a, Nutlin-3a(OC), and tested the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this new formulation in genetic and human retinoblastoma orthotopic xenograft models of retinoblastoma. Here, we show that Nutlin-3a(OC) specifically and efficiently targets the p53 pathway and that the combination of Nutlin-3a(OC) with systemic topotecan is a significantly better treatment for retinoblastoma than currently used chemotherapy in human orthotopic xenografts. Our studies provide a new standardized approach to evaluate and prioritize novel agents for incorporation into future clinical trials for retinoblastoma.;;Most human tumours have genetic mutations in their Rb and p53 pathways, but retinoblastoma is thought to be an exception.

Effects of TSA and MS-275 were also assessed in combination with standard therapeutic agents for RB. Proapoptotic effects of MS-275 and TSA were evaluated by caspase-3/7 activity, Annexin V translocation, and/or Bim expression analyses. Effects of MS-275 on cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species levels were determined by flow cytometry. Retinal tissue morphology was evaluated in mice after local administration of MS-275. Analysis of retinal acetyl-histone levels was used to assess MS-275 delivery after systemic administration.

New nodes of therapeutic intervention are needed that can delay or combat the onset of malignancies. The antitumor properties and mechanistic functions of PD-0332991 (PD; a potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitor) were investigated using human prostate cancer (PCa) models and primary tumors. PD significantly impaired the capacity of PCa cells to proliferate by promoting a robust G1-arrest. Accordingly, key regulators of the G1-S cell cycle transition were modulated including G1 cyclins D, E and A. Subsequent investigation demonstrated the ability of PD to function in the presence of existing hormone-based regimens and to cooperate with ionizing radiation to further suppress cellular growth. Importantly, it was determined that PD is a critical mediator of PD action. The anti-proliferative impact of CDK4/6 inhibition was revealed through reduced proliferation and delayed growth using PCa cell xenografts. Finally, first-in-field effects of PD on proliferation were observed in primary human prostatectomy tumor tissue explants. This study shows that selective CDK4/6 inhibition, using PD either as a single-agent or in combination, hinders key proliferative pathways necessary for disease progression and that RB status is a critical prognostic determinant for therapeutic efficacy. Combined, these pre-clinical findings identify selective targeting of CDK4/6 as a bona fide therapeutic target in both early stage and advanced PCa and underscore the benefit of personalized medicine to enhance treatment response. ;;Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before cystectomy is the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), with 25-50% of patients expected to achieve a pathologic response. Validated biomarkers predictive of response are currently lacking. To discover and validate biomarkers predictive of response to NAC for MIBC. Pretreatment MIBC samples prospectively collected from patients treated in two separate clinical trials of cisplatin-based NAC provided the discovery and validation sets. DNA from pretreatment tumor tissue was sequenced for all coding exons of 287 cancer-related genes and was analyzed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and selected rearrangements in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments-certified laboratory. The mean number of variants and variant status for each gene were correlated with response. Variant data from the discovery cohort were used to create a classification tree to discriminate responders from nonresponders. The resulting decision rule was then tested in the independent validation set. Patients with a pathologic complete response had more alterations than those with residual tumor in both the discovery (p=0.024) and validation (p=0.018) sets. In the discovery set, alteration in one or more of the three DNA repair genes ATM, RB1, and FANCC predicted pathologic response (p<0.001; 87% sensitivity, 100% specificity) and better overall survival (p=0.007).

Chemotherapy given before bladder removal (cystectomy) improves the chance of cure for some but not all patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We found a set of genetic mutations that when present in tumor tissue predict benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that testing before chemotherapy may help in selecting patients for whom this approach is recommended.

Adaptive signaling may underlie early BRAFi resistance and influence the selection pattern for genetic variants, causing late, acquired resistance. We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy.	Shi H. et al.,Cancer Discov,2014

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Pathologic downstaging to pT0/pTis after neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with improved survival, although molecular determinants of cisplatin response are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on pretreatment tumor and germline DNA from 50 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by cystectomy (25 pT0/pTis \"responders,\" 25 pT2+ \"nonresponders\") to identify somatic mutations that occurred preferentially in responders. ERCC2, a nucleotide excision repair gene, was the only significantly mutated gene enriched in the cisplatin responders compared with nonresponders (q < 0.01). Expression of representative ERCC2 mutants in an ERCC2-deficient cell line failed to rescue cisplatin and UV sensitivity compared with wild-type ERCC2. The lack of normal ERCC2 function may contribute to cisplatin sensitivity in urothelial cancer, and somatic ERCC2 mutation status may inform cisplatin-containing regimen usage in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. Somatic ERCC2 mutations correlate with complete response to cisplatin-based chemosensitivity in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, and clinically identified mutations lead to cisplatin sensitivity in vitro. Nucleotide excision repair pathway defects may drive exceptional response to conventional chemotherapy."	Van Allen EM. et al.,Cancer Discov,2014

It inhibits angiogenic pathways by mainly targeting the receptors of VEGF and PDGF. In ccRCC, angiogenesis is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) which in turn leads to the induction of HIF1α target genes such as CA9 and VEGF. Furthermore, the angiogenic phenotype of ccRCC is also reflected by endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) or other tumor-promoting factors like Ki67 or survivin. Tissue microarrays from primary tumor specimens of 42 patients with metastatic ccRCC under sunitinib therapy were immunohistochemically stained for selected markers related to angiogenesis. The prognostic and predictive potential of theses markers was assessed on the basis of the objective response rate which was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria after 3, 6, 9 months and after last report (12-54 months) of sunitinib treatment. Additionally, VHL copy number and mutation analyses were performed on DNA from cryo-preserved tumor tissues of 20 ccRCC patients. Immunostaining of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β was significantly associated with the sunitinib response after 6 and 9 months as well as last report under therapy. Furthermore, HIF-1α, CA9, CD34, VEGFR1 and -3 and PDGRFα showed significant associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses high CA9 membrane staining and a response after 9 months were independent prognostic factors for longer OS. Frequently observed copy number loss and mutation of VHL gene lead to altered expression of VHL, HIF-1α, CA9, and VEGF. Immunoexpression of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β in the primary tumors of metastatic ccRCC patients might support the prediction of a good response to sunitinib treatment.

This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.

Mechanisms of resistance to everolimus remain undefined. Resistance developed in a patient with metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma after an extraordinary 18-month response. Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment and drug-resistant tumors revealed a nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR, suggesting a mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. The resistant tumor also harbored a mutation in MTOR that confers resistance to allosteric mTOR inhibition. The mutation remains sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors.	Wagle N. et al.,N. Engl. J.

In this study, we present therapeutically relevant genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma of Indian origin. Forty-five primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors were sequenced for 676 amplicons using RainDance cancer panel at an average coverage of 1500 × (reads per million mapped reads). To validate the findings, 49 mutations across 23 genes were genotyped in an additional set of 363 primary lung adenocarcinoma tumors using mass spectrometry. NIH/3T3 cells over expressing mutant and wild-type FGFR3 constructs were characterized for anchorage independent growth, constitutive activation, tumor formation and sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors using in vitro and xenograft mouse models. We present the first spectrum of actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinoma tumors of Indian origin, and shows that mutations of FGFR3 are present in 20 of 363 (5.5%) patients. These FGFR3 mutations are constitutively active and oncogenic when ectopically expressed in NIH/3T3 cells and using a xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice. Inhibition of FGFR3 kinase activity inhibits transformation of NIH/3T3 overexpressing FGFR3 constructs and growth of tumors driven by FGFR3 in the xenograft models. The reduction in tumor size in the mouse is paralleled by a reduction in the amounts of phospho-ERK, validating the in vitro findings. Interestingly, the FGFR3 mutations are significantly higher in a proportion of younger patients and show a trend toward better overall survival, compared with patients lacking actionable alterations or those harboring KRAS mutations. We present the first actionable mutation spectrum in Indian lung cancer genome. These findings implicate FGFR3 as a novel therapeutic in lung adenocarcinoma.	Chandrani P. et al.,Ann. Oncol.,2017

Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.;;The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	;;Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011;;Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011;;Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011;;Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011;;Pemovska T. et al.,Nature,2015

The purpose of this study was to determine the response rate (RR) for the selective, allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma. This was an open-label, two-stage, phase II study with two cohorts. Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily. In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed. Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.,,MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future.

In addition, moderate clinical efficacy of the EGFR-TKI, erlotinib, has been shown in lung cancer patients with the wild-type EGFR. Numerous molecular mechanisms that cause acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs have been identified in lung cancers with the EGFR mutations; however, few have been reported in lung cancers with the wild-type EGFR. We used H358 lung adenocarcinoma cells lacking EGFR mutations that showed modest sensitivity to erlotinib. The H358 cells acquired resistance to erlotinib via chronic exposure to the drug. The H358 erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells do not have a secondary EGFR mutation, neither MET gene amplification nor PTEN downregulation; these have been identified in lung cancers with the EGFR mutations. From comprehensive screening of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, we observed increased phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) in H358ER cells compared with parental H358 cells. H358ER cells responded to combined therapy with erlotinib and NVP-AEW541, an IGF1R-TKI. Our results indicate that IGF1R activation is a molecular mechanism that confers acquired resistance to erlotinib in lung cancers with the wild-type EGFR.	Suda K. et al.,Int. J. Cancer,2014

In lung SCC, one of the most frequently altered receptor tyrosine kinase families is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, with amplification or mutation observed in all four family members. Here, we describe the oncogenic nature of mutations observed in FGFR2 and FGFR3, each of which are observed in 3% of samples, for a mutation rate of 6% across both genes. Using cell culture and xenograft models, we show that several of these mutations drive cellular transformation. Transformation can be reversed by small-molecule FGFR inhibitors currently being developed for clinical use. We also show that mutations in the extracellular domains of FGFR2 lead to constitutive FGFR dimerization. In addition, we report a patient with an FGFR2-mutated oral SCC who responded to the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. These findings provide new insights into driving oncogenic events in a subset of lung squamous cancers, and recommend future clinical studies with FGFR inhibitors in patients with lung and head and neck SCC.,,Somatic mutations in FGFR2 are present in 4% to 5% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Amplification and mutations in FGFR genes have been identified in patients with NSCLCs, and clinical trials are testing the efficacy of anti-FGFR therapies. FGFR2 and other FGFR kinase family gene alterations have been found in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, although mouse models of FGFR-driven lung cancers have not been reported. Here, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of NSCLC driven by a kinase domain mutation in FGFR2. Combined with p53 ablation, primary grade 3/4 adenocarcinoma was induced in the lung epithelial compartment exhibiting locally invasive and pleiotropic tendencies largely made up of multinucleated cells. Tumors were acutely sensitive to pan-FGFR inhibition. This is the first FGFR2-driven lung cancer GEMM, which can be applied across different cancer indications in a preclinical setting.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01283516.).,,To extend the results of a phase III trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinomas harboring EML4-ALK fusion. We conducted a co-clinical trial in a mouse model comparing the ALK inhibitor crizotinib to the standard-of-care cytotoxic agents docetaxel or pemetrexed. Concordant with the clinical outcome in humans, crizotinib produced a substantially higher response rate compared with chemotherapy, associated with significantly longer progression-free survival. Overall survival was also prolonged in crizotinib- compared with chemotherapy-treated mice. Pemetrexed produced superior overall survival compared with docetaxel, suggesting that this agent may be the preferred chemotherapy in the ALK population. In addition, in the EML4-ALK-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, HSP90 inhibition can overcome both primary and acquired crizotinib resistance. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition, as well as the second-generation ALK inhibitor TAE684, demonstrated activity in newly developed lung adenocarcinoma models driven by crizotinib-insensitive EML4-ALK L1196M or F1174L.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Pathologic diagnosis following open radical nephrectomy was papillary renal cell carcinoma, G2, pT2aN0M1. Subsequently, the patient was sequentially treated with interleukin-2 (3 months (mo), progressive disease (PD)), interferon-alpha (3 mo, PD), and oral S-1 as a clinical trial (28 mo, PD). Because of skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax history, Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome was suspected during the treatment course, despite his having no family history of the disease. Subsequent genetic testing revealed a FLCN germline mutation (c. 1285dupC). He was started on molecular-targeting therapies sequentially, i.e., sorafenib (1 mo, PD), sunitinib (4 mo, PD), and everolimus (7 mo, PD). The patient died of progressive disease at 78 mo from the initial nephrectomy and 30 mo from the start of targeted agents. Loss of FLCN function has been shown to result in the upregulation of the PI3K/mTORC1 pathway in both in vitro experiments and in vivo FLCN knockout mice models. Despite its use as the sixth-line systematic treatment, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus exhibited a relatively long-term effect as compared with the previously used tyrosine kinase inhibitors and in contrast to the results in the RECORD-1 clinical trial. This finding may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of BHDassociated renal tumors. ;;Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is effective in treating tumors harboring alterations in the mTOR pathway. Mechanisms of resistance to everolimus remain undefined. Resistance developed in a patient with metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma after an extraordinary 18-month response. Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment and drug-resistant tumors revealed a nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR, suggesting a mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. The resistant tumor also harbored a mutation in MTOR that confers resistance to allosteric mTOR inhibition. The mutation remains sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors.

It inhibits angiogenic pathways by mainly targeting the receptors of VEGF and PDGF. In ccRCC, angiogenesis is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) which in turn leads to the induction of HIF1α target genes such as CA9 and VEGF. Furthermore, the angiogenic phenotype of ccRCC is also reflected by endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) or other tumor-promoting factors like Ki67 or survivin. Tissue microarrays from primary tumor specimens of 42 patients with metastatic ccRCC under sunitinib therapy were immunohistochemically stained for selected markers related to angiogenesis. The prognostic and predictive potential of theses markers was assessed on the basis of the objective response rate which was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria after 3, 6, 9 months and after last report (12-54 months) of sunitinib treatment. Additionally, VHL copy number and mutation analyses were performed on DNA from cryo-preserved tumor tissues of 20 ccRCC patients. Immunostaining of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β was significantly associated with the sunitinib response after 6 and 9 months as well as last report under therapy. Furthermore, HIF-1α, CA9, CD34, VEGFR1 and -3 and PDGRFα showed significant associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses high CA9 membrane staining and a response after 9 months were independent prognostic factors for longer OS. Frequently observed copy number loss and mutation of VHL gene lead to altered expression of VHL, HIF-1α, CA9, and VEGF.

This study included a total of 40 consecutive patients undergoing radical nephrectomy, who were diagnosed as having metastatic RCC and subsequently treated with sunitinib. Expression levels of 10 molecular markers, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, phosphorylated Akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and signal transducers and activation of transcription 3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 and -2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and -β, in primary RCC specimens were assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Of several factors examined, tumor grade and the expression level of VEGFR-2 were shown to have significant impacts on response to sunitinib in these 40 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly associated with the expression levels of VEGFR-2 in addition to tumor grade, performance status, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk classification and pretreatment c-reactive protein level on univariate analysis. Of these significant factors, only VEGFR-2 expression appeared to be independently related to PFS on multivariate analysis. In fact, PFS in patients with strong expression of VEGFR-2 was significantly favorable compared with that in those with weak expression of VEGFR-2.

mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor result in deregulated Ras signaling and drive tumorigenesis in the familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type I. However, the extent to which NF1 inactivation promotes sporadic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we report that NF1 is inactivated in sporadic gliomas via two mechanisms: excessive proteasomal degradation and genetic loss. NF1 protein destabilization is triggered by the hyperactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) and confers sensitivity to PKC inhibitors. However, complete genetic loss, which only occurs when p53 is inactivated, mediates sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. These studies reveal an expanding role for NF1 inactivation in sporadic gliomagenesis and illustrate how different mechanisms of inactivation are utilized in genetically distinct tumors, which consequently impacts therapeutic sensitivity.,,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19% to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines. Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001 significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1 patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with RAD001.,,This study was conducted to identify novel genes with importance to the biology of adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We analyzed DNA from highly purified AML blasts and paired buccal cells from 95 patients for recurrent genomic microdeletions using ultra-high density Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array-based genomic profiling. Through fine mapping of microdeletions on 17q, we derived a minimal deleted region of approximately 0.9-Mb length that harbors 11 known genes; this region includes Neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Sequence analysis of all NF1 coding exons in the 11 AML cases with NF1 copy number changes identified acquired truncating frameshift mutations in two patients. These NF1 mutations were already present in the hematopoetic stem cell compartment. Subsequent expression analysis of NF1 mRNA in the entire AML cohort using fluorescence-activated cell sorting sorted blasts as a source of RNA identified six patients (one with a NF1 mutation) with absent NF1 expression. The NF1 null states were associated with increased Ras-bound GTP, and short hairpin RNA-mediated NF1 suppression in primary AML blasts with wild-type NF1 facilitated colony formation in methylcellulose. Primary AML blasts without functional NF1, unlike blasts with functional NF1, displayed sensitivity to rapamycin-induced apoptosis, thus identifying a dependence on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling for survival. Finally, colony formation in methylcellulose ex vivo of NF1 null CD34+/CD38- cells sorted from AML bone marrow samples was inhibited by low-dose rapamycin. NF1 null states are present in 7 of 95 (7%) of adult AML and delineate a disease subset that could be preferentially targeted by Ras or mammalian target of rapamycin-directed therapeutics.,,Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene are common in cancer and can cause resistance to therapy. Using transcriptome analysis we identified MAF as an NF1- regulated transcription factor and verified MAF regulation through RAS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines. MAF was also downregulated in human MPNST. Acute re-expression of MAF promoted expression of glial differentiation markers in MPNST cells in vitro, decreased self-renewal of embryonic precursors and transiently affected tumor cell phenotypes in vitro by increasing MPNST cell death and reducing metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, chronic MAF overexpression enhanced MPNST cell tumor growth in vivo, correlating with elevated pS6 in vitro and in vivo. RAD001 blocked MAF-mediated tumor growth, and MAF regulated the mTOR pathway through DEPTOR. MAPK inhibition with NF1 loss of function is predicted to show limited efficacy due to reactivation of mTOR signaling via MAF. ;;Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor result in deregulated Ras signaling and drive tumorigenesis in the familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type I. However, the extent to which NF1 inactivation promotes sporadic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we report that NF1 is inactivated in sporadic gliomas via two mechanisms: excessive proteasomal degradation and genetic loss. NF1 protein destabilization is triggered by the hyperactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) and confers sensitivity to PKC inhibitors. However, complete genetic loss, which only occurs when p53 is inactivated, mediates sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. These studies reveal an expanding role for NF1 inactivation in sporadic gliomagenesis and illustrate how different mechanisms of inactivation are utilized in genetically distinct tumors, which consequently impacts therapeutic sensitivity.,,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are chemoresistant sarcomas with poor 5-year survival that arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or sporadically. We tested three drugs for single and combinatorial effects on collected MPNST cell lines and in MPNST xenografts. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) decreased growth 19% to 60% after 4 days of treatment in NF1 and sporadic-derived MPNST cell lines. Treatment of subcutaneous sporadic MPNST cell xenografts with RAD001 significantly, but transiently, delayed tumor growth, and decreased vessel permeability within xenografts. RAD001 combined with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib caused additional inhibitory effects on growth and apoptosis in vitro, and a small but significant additional inhibitory effect on MPNST growth in vivo that were larger than the effects of RAD001 with doxorubicin. RAD001 plus erlotinib, in vitro and in vivo, reduced phosphorylation of AKT and total AKT levels, possibly accounting for their additive effect. The results support the consideration of RAD001 therapy in NF1 patient and sporadic MPNST. The preclinical tests described allow rapid screening strata for drugs that block MPNST growth, prior to tests in more complex models, and should be useful to identify drugs that synergize with RAD001.,,This study was conducted to identify novel genes with importance to the biology of adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

This variability in clinical response to RA is enigmatic, as no mutations in components of the RA signaling cascade have been found. Using a large-scale RNAi genetic screen, we identify crosstalk between the tumor suppressor NF1 and retinoic acid-induced differentiation in neuroblastoma. Loss of NF1 activates RAS-MEK signaling, which in turn represses ZNF423, a critical transcriptional coactivator of the retinoic acid receptors. Neuroblastomas with low levels of both NF1 and ZNF423 have extremely poor outcome. We find NF1 mutations in neuroblastoma cell lines and in primary tumors. Inhibition of MEK signaling downstream of NF1 restores responsiveness to RA, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to overcome RA resistance in NF1-deficient neuroblastomas.;;Retinoic acid (RA) induces differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and is used with variable success to treat aggressive forms of this disease.

Guided by clinical observations suggesting that some NF1-associated nerve sheath tumors are hormonally responsive, we hypothesized that the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator tamoxifen would inhibit MPNST tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined tamoxifen effects on MPNST cell proliferation and survival, MPNST xenograft growth, and the mechanism by which tamoxifen impeded these processes. We found that 1-5 μM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen induced MPNST cell death, whereas 0.01-0.1 μM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen inhibited mitogenesis. Dermal and plexiform neurofibromas, MPNSTs, and MPNST cell lines expressed ERβ and G-protein-coupled ER-1 (GPER); MPNSTs also expressed estrogen biosynthetic enzymes. However, MPNST cells did not secrete 17β-estradiol, exogenous 17β-estradiol did not stimulate mitogenesis or rescue 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen effects on MPNST cells, and the steroidal antiestrogen ICI-182,780 did not mimic tamoxifen effects on MPNST cells. Further, ablation of ERβ and GPER had no effect on MPNST proliferation, survival, or tamoxifen sensitivity, indicating that tamoxifen acts via an ER-independent mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibitors of calmodulin (trifluoperazine, W-7), another known tamoxifen target, recapitulated 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen effects on MPNST cells. Tamoxifen was also effective in vivo, demonstrating potent antitumor activity in mice orthotopically xenografted with human MPNST cells. We conclude that 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen inhibits MPNST cell proliferation and survival via an ER-independent mechanism. The in vivo effectiveness of tamoxifen provides a rationale for clinical trials in cases of MPNSTs.;;Few therapeutic options are available for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Here we identify a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for two Ras-driven cancers: Nf1-deficient malignancies and Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer. We show that agents that enhance proteotoxic stress, including the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, induce tumor regression in aggressive mouse models, but only when combined with rapamycin. These agents synergize by promoting irresolvable ER stress, resulting in catastrophic ER and mitochondrial damage. This process is fueled by oxidative stress, which is caused by IPI-504-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, and the rapamycin-dependent suppression of glutathione, an important endogenous antioxidant. Notably, the mechanism by which these agents cooperate reveals a therapeutic paradigm that can be expanded to develop additional combinations.;;Ras-driven tumors are often refractory to conventional therapies.

Patients <21 years of age with recurrent LGGs who had failed conventional treatment were eligible, including those with NF1. The treatment consisted of two phases, a feasibility portion which assessed the toxicity of erlotinib at 65 mg/m(2) /day once daily and rapamycin at 0.8 mg/m(2) /dose twice daily for 28 consecutive days. Nineteen (19) patients, median age of 8 years, with recurrent LGGs received the two-drug regimen. Eight (8) of the patients had NF1. The combination of erlotinib and rapamycin was well tolerated and no patient was removed from study due to toxicity. All 19 patients were evaluable for response and one child, with NF1, had a partial response to treatment. Six (6) patients received the planned 12 courses of treatment. The reasons for stoppage of therapy before 1 year of treatment were poor compliance (1), parental desire for withdrawal (1), persistent vomiting which pre-dated initiation of therapy (1), and radiographic progression (10). In those patients with stabilization of disease for 12 months or greater, 3 stayed on therapy and ultimately developed progressive disease, and one patient stopped therapy at 12 months and progressed. Two (2) patients, both with NF1, have had >1 year disease control. The combination of rapamycin and erlotinib is well tolerated in children with LGGs. Objective responses were infrequent, although there was prolonged disease stabilization in some patients with LGGs, especially in two children with NF1.;;To determine the toxicity and efficacy of rapamycin and erlotinib for the treatment of recurrent pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs).

Because NF1-deficient acute myeloid leukemias are sensitive to MEK inhibitors, we investigated here whether NF1-deficient glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) would respond to MEK inhibition. In 19 GBM cell lines, we found that treatment with the clinically available MEK inhibitors PD0325901 or AZD6244 decreased levels of phospho-ERK, the downstream effector of MEK, regardless of NF1 status. However, growth inhibition occurred only in a subset of NF1-deficient cells, in association with decreased levels of cyclin D1, increased levels of p27, and G1 arrest. As a single agent, PD0325901 suppressed the growth of NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells in vivo as well. Mechanistically, NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells were dependent upon the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway for growth and did not activate the PI3K pathway as a mechanism of acquired resistance. Importantly, NF1-deficient cells intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition were sensitized by the addition of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103. Taken together, our findings indicate that a subset of NF1-deficient GBMs may respond to MEK inhibitors currently being tested in clinical trials.,,The cascade comprising Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a therapeutic target in human cancers with deregulated Ras signalling, which includes tumours that have inactivated the Nf1 tumour suppressor. Nf1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein that terminates Ras signalling by stimulating hydrolysis of Ras-GTP. We compared the effects of inhibitors of MEK in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) initiated by inactivating Nf1 in mouse bone marrow and in acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) in which cooperating mutations were induced by retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Here we show that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in MPD, but induce objective regression of many Nf1-deficient AMLs. Drug resistance developed because of outgrowth of AML clones that were present before treatment. We cloned clone-specific retroviral integrations to identify candidate resistance genes including Rasgrp1, Rasgrp4 and Mapk14, which encodes p38alpha. Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38 kinase activity in resistance to MEK inhibitors. This approach represents a robust strategy for identifying genes and pathways that modulate how primary cancer cells respond to targeted therapeutics and for probing mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance.;;Loss of neurofibromin 1 (NF1) leads to hyperactivation of RAS, which in turn signals through the RAF/MEK/ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathways to regulate cell growth and survival.

Currently, there are no viable therapeutic options for patients with plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be surgically removed because of their proximity to vital body structures. We undertook an open-label phase 2 trial to test whether treatment with imatinib mesylate can decrease the volume burden of clinically significant plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1. Eligible patients had to be aged 3-65 years, and to have NF1 and a clinically significant plexiform neurofibroma. Patients were treated with daily oral imatinib mesylate at 220 mg/m(2) twice a day for children and 400 mg twice a day for adults for 6 months. The primary endpoint was a 20% or more reduction in plexiform size by sequential volumetric MRI imaging. Clinical data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; a secondary analysis was also done for those patients able to take imatinib mesylate for 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01673009. Six of 36 patients (17%, 95% CI 6-33), enrolled on an intention-to-treat basis, had an objective response to imatinib mesylate, with a 20% or more decrease in tumour volume. Of the 23 patients who received imatinib mesylate for at least 6 months, six (26%, 95% CI 10-48) had a 20% or more decrease in volume of one or more plexiform tumours. The most common adverse events were skin rash (five patients) and oedema with weight gain (six). More serious adverse events included reversible grade 3 neutropenia (two), grade 4 hyperglycaemia (one), and grade 4 increases in aminotransferase concentrations (one). Imatinib mesylate could be used to treat plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1. A multi-institutional clinical trial is warranted to confirm these results.

We found that macrophage infiltration of both mouse and human neurofibromas correlates with disease progression. Macrophages accounted for almost half of neurofibroma cells, leading us to hypothesize that nerve macrophages are inflammatory effectors in neurofibroma development and/or growth. We tested the effects of PLX3397, a dual kit/fms kinase inhibitor that blocks macrophage infiltration, in the Dhh-Cre; Nf1(flox/flox) mouse model of GEM grade I neurofibroma. In mice aged 1-4 months, prior to development of nerve pathology and neurofibroma formation, PLX3397 did not impair tumor initiation and increased tumor volume compared to controls. However, in mice aged 7-9 months, after tumor establishment, a subset of mice demonstrating the largest reductions in macrophages after PLX3397 exhibited cell death and tumor volume regression. Macrophages are likely to provide an initial line of defense against developing tumors. Once tumors are established, they become tumor permissive. Macrophage depletion may result in impaired tumor maintenance and represent a therapeutic strategy for neurofibroma therapy.;;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disease that predisposes 30-50 % of affected individuals to develop plexiform neurofibromas.

Here, we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf-mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and mTOR. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and show that NF1/neurofibromin inactivation may have an impact on responses to targeted therapies.;;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients develop benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These incurable peripheral nerve tumors result from loss of NF1 tumor suppressor gene function, causing hyperactive Ras signaling. Activated Ras controls numerous downstream effectors, but specific pathways mediating the effects of hyperactive Ras in NF1 tumors are unknown. We performed cross-species transcriptome analyses of mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNSTs and identified global negative feedback of genes that regulate Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in both species. Nonetheless, ERK activation was sustained in mouse and human neurofibromas and MPNST. We used a highly selective pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, PD0325901, to test whether sustained Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling contributes to neurofibroma growth in a neurofibromatosis mouse model (Nf1(fl/fl);Dhh-Cre) or in NF1 patient MPNST cell xenografts. PD0325901 treatment reduced aberrantly proliferating cells in neurofibroma and MPNST, prolonged survival of mice implanted with human MPNST cells, and shrank neurofibromas in more than 80% of mice tested. Our data demonstrate that deregulated Ras/ERK signaling is critical for the growth of NF1 peripheral nerve tumors and provide a strong rationale for testing MEK inhibitors in NF1 clinical trials.;;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients develop benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).

In this study, we examined the efficiency of nilotinib on PNF-derived Schwann cells and on cells of established MPNST lines in vitro. Nilotinib treatment for 10 days led to decreased proliferation, viability and vitality of the cells with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC50) for proliferation varying from 3.1 to 9.0 μM. We further addressed selectivity of the drug for tumor cells by simultaneously examining its efficacy on tumor cells (Schwann cells) and non-tumor cells (fibroblasts) from the same tumor. For four out of the six PNFs studied, IC50 was lower in Schwann cells than in fibroblasts for all parameters measured (proliferation, vitality and viability), indicating good drug selectivity. In addition, nilotinib induced apoptosis and suppressed collagenase activity. Our results suggest that nilotinib may provide a treatment option for some PNFs and MPNSTs and our in vitro model of comparative treatment on tumor and non-tumor cells may provide a prototype of preclinical drug screening system toward personalized treatment.;;Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a tumor suppressor gene disorder which predisposes patients to cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) among other neoplasias and manifestation.

We further addressed selectivity of the drug for tumor cells by simultaneously examining its efficacy on tumor cells (Schwann cells) and non-tumor cells (fibroblasts) from the same tumor. For four out of the six PNFs studied, IC50 was lower in Schwann cells than in fibroblasts for all parameters measured (proliferation, vitality and viability), indicating good drug selectivity. In addition, nilotinib induced apoptosis and suppressed collagenase activity. Our results suggest that nilotinib may provide a treatment option for some PNFs and MPNSTs and our in vitro model of comparative treatment on tumor and non-tumor cells may provide a prototype of preclinical drug screening system toward personalized treatment.;;Children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) frequently experience vision loss from their tumors. Standard front-line treatment using carboplatin-based chemotherapy typically produces only a modest benefit (eg, stabilization or 0.2 logMAR improvement) in visual acuity (VA). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor and acts primarily as an anti-angiogenic agent. Recent reports suggest a qualitative improvement in vision after bevacizumab-based treatment in children with OPGs. We report 4 cases of pediatric OPGs (2 neurofibromatosis type 1-related and 2 sporadic cases) that received treatment with bevacizumab due to progressive VA or visual field (VF) loss despite prior treatment with chemotherapy or proton-beam radiation. All 4 subjects demonstrated a marked improvement in their VA, VF, or both while receiving bevacizumab-based therapy. Three patients had complete resolution of their VA or VF loss in at least 1 eye-2 of whom had previously received bevacizumab therapy. Given that most patients with OPG-related visual impairment will show modest or no visual improvement with standard treatment, the incorporation of bevacizumab in these cases may greatly improve visual outcomes and should be considered in appropriate clinical situations.,,;;Children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) frequently experience vision loss from their tumors.

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SqCC), recent studies have suggested that DDR2 mutations are a biomarker for therapeutic response to dasatinib and clinical trials are underway testing this hypothesis. Although targeted therapeutics are typically quite effective as initial therapy for patients with lung cancer, nearly all patients develop resistance with long-term exposure to targeted drugs. Here, we use DDR2-dependent lung cancer cell lines to model acquired resistance to dasatinib therapy. We perform targeted exome sequencing to identify two distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance: acquisition of the T654I gatekeeper mutation in DDR2 and loss of NF1. We show that NF1 loss activates a bypass pathway, which confers ERK dependency downstream of RAS activation. These results indicate that acquired resistance to dasatinib can occur via both second-site mutations in DDR2 and by activation of bypass pathways. These data may help to anticipate mechanisms of resistance that may be identified in upcoming clinical trials of anti-DDR2 therapy in lung cancer and suggest strategies to overcome resistance.;;The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer has evolved dramatically over the past decade with the adoption of widespread use of effective targeted therapies in patients with distinct molecular alterations.

There is no effective treatment for MPNSTs and they are typically fatal. To gain insights into MPNST pathogenesis, we utilized an MPNST mouse model that allowed us to study the evolution of these tumors at the transcriptome level. Strikingly, in MPNSTs we found upregulation of a chromatin regulator, Brd4, and show that BRD4 inhibition profoundly suppresses both growth and tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal roles for BET bromodomains in MPNST development and report a mechanism by which bromodomain inhibition induces apoptosis through induction of proapoptotic Bim, which may represent a paradigm shift in therapy for MPNST patients. Moreover, these findings indicate epigenetic mechanisms underlying the balance of anti- and proapoptotic molecules and that bromodomain inhibition can shift this balance in favor of cancer cell apoptosis. ;;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive sarcomas that develop sporadically or in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients.

The activity of tipifarnib, which blocks RAS signaling by inhibiting its farnesylation, was tested in children and young adults with NF1 and progressive PNs. Patients aged 3-25 years with NF1-related PNs and imaging evidence of tumor progression were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive tipifarnib (200 mg/m(2) orally every 12 h) or placebo (phase A) and crossed over to the opposite treatment arm at the time of tumor progression (phase B). PN volumes were measured with MRI, and progression was defined as ≥20% volume increase. Time to progression (TTP) in phase A was the primary endpoint, and the trial was powered to detect whether tipifarnib doubled TTP compared with placebo. Toxicity, response, and quality of life were also monitored. Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Tipifarnib and placebo were well tolerated. On phase A, the median TTP was 10.6 months on the placebo arm and 19.2 months on the tipifarnib arm (P = .12; 1-sided). Quality of life improved significantly compared with baseline on the tipifarnib arm but not on the placebo arm. Volumetric tumor measurement detected tumor progression earlier than conventional 2-dimensional (WHO) and 1-dimensional (RECIST) methods. Tipifarnib was well tolerated but did not significantly prolong TTP of PNs compared with placebo. The randomized, flexible crossover design and volumetric PN assessment provided a feasible and efficient means of assessing the efficacy of tipifarnib. The placebo arm serves as an historical control group for phase 2 single-arm trials directed at progressive PNs.;;RAS is dysregulated in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

However, resistance eventually arises, often due to a second EGFR mutation, most commonly T790M. Through a genome-wide siRNA screen in a human lung cancer cell line and analyses of murine mutant EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinomas, we found that erlotinib resistance was associated with reduced expression of neurofibromin, the RAS GTPase-activating protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Erlotinib failed to fully inhibit RAS-ERK signaling when neurofibromin levels were reduced. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. These findings identify a subgroup of patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma who might benefit from combination therapy with EGFR and MEK inhibitors.;;Activating mutations in the EGF receptor (EGFR) are associated with clinical responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as erlotinib and gefitinib.

Although 70% of cutaneous melanomas harbor activating mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes, the alterations that drive tumor progression in the remaining 30% are largely undefined. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of RAF kinases, has clinical utility restricted to BRAF-mutant tumors. MEK inhibitors, which have shown clinical activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma, may be effective in other ERK pathway-dependent settings. Here, we investigated a panel of melanoma cell lines wild type for BRAF and NRAS to determine the genetic alteration driving their transformation and their dependence on ERK signaling in order to elucidate a candidate set for MEK inhibitor treatment. A cohort of the BRAF/RAS wild type cell lines with high levels of RAS-GTP had loss of NF1, a RAS GTPase activating protein. In these cell lines, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but also relieved feedback inhibition of RAS, resulting in induction of pMEK and a rapid rebound in ERK signaling. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor trametinib impaired the adaptive response of cells to ERK inhibition, leading to sustained suppression of ERK signaling and significant antitumor effects. Notably, alterations in NF1 frequently co-occurred with RAS and BRAF alterations in melanoma. In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss abrogated negative feedback on RAS activation, resulting in elevated activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF, but not MEK, inhibitors. We conclude that loss of NF1 is common in cutaneous melanoma and is associated with RAS activation, MEK-dependence, and resistance to RAF inhibition.,,A novel, powerful and T-cell-specific enhancer element has been identified at 3 kb 3' of the mouse T cell receptor (TCR) C alpha (constant) gene. A previous report of an intragenic enhancer could not be confirmed. The unique organization of the TCR alpha locus and transcriptional data of the alpha promoter suggest that this enhancer can act over 69 kb. This feature of the alpha enhancer may lead to deregulation of c-myc and other oncogenes translocated to this locus in many T cell leukemias, resulting in T cell neoplasia. The enhancer was localized to 230 bp of DNA and has been found to be inducible in an immature T lymphoid cell line. Deletions localizing critical regions and T-cell-specific binding proteins of this enhancer are described.;;Melanoma is a disease characterized by lesions that activate ERK.

This work aimed to evaluate our experience integrating these two strategies to personalize the treatment of patients with cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing analysis of 25 patients with advanced solid tumors to identify putatively actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations. Avatar models were used as an in vivo platform to test proposed treatment strategies. Successful exome sequencing analyses have been obtained for 23 patients. Tumor-specific mutations and copy-number variations were identified. All samples profiled contained relevant genomic alterations. Tumor was implanted to create an Avatar model from 14 patients and 10 succeeded. Occasionally, actionable alterations such as mutations in NF1, PI3KA, and DDR2 failed to provide any benefit when a targeted drug was tested in the Avatar and, accordingly, treatment of the patients with these drugs was not effective. To date, 13 patients have received a personalized treatment and 6 achieved durable partial remissions. Prior testing of candidate treatments in Avatar models correlated with clinical response and helped to select empirical treatments in some patients with no actionable mutations. The use of full genomic analysis for cancer care is encouraging but presents important challenges that will need to be solved for broad clinical application. Avatar models are a promising investigational platform for therapeutic decision making. While limitations still exist, this strategy should be further tested.;;Current technology permits an unbiased massive analysis of somatic genetic alterations from tumor DNA as well as the generation of individualized mouse xenografts (Avatar models).

MPNSTs have been shown to have gene amplification for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), PDGFR and c-Kit. We tested the c-Kit inhibitor, imatinib, and PLX3397, a selective c-Fms and c-Kit inhibitor, to evaluate their efficacy against MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo. We tested the efficacy of imatinib or PLX3397 either alone or in combination with TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in a cell proliferation assay in vitro and by immunoblotting to determine target inhibition. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis was further carried out using xenograft samples in vivo. Our in vitro studies show that imatinib and PLX3397 similarly inhibit cell growth and this can be enhanced with rapamycin with comparable target specificity. However, in vivo studies clearly demonstrate that compared with imatinib, PLX3397 results in sustained blockade of c-Kit, c-Fms, and PDGFRβ, resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth. Moreover, staining for Iba-1, a marker for macrophages, indicates that PLX3397 results in significant depletion of macrophages in the growing tumors. The combination of PLX3397 and rapamycin results in even greater macrophage depletion with continued growth suppression, even when the drug treatment is discontinued. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that PLX3397 is superior to imatinib in the treatment of MPNSTs, and the combination of PLX3397 with a TORC1 inhibitor could provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of this disease.;;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive tumor type that is resistant to chemotherapy and there are no effective therapies.

The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when treated with therapies targeting mTOR. ;;Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that arise in one-third of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). They may cause significant disfigurement, compression of vital structures, neurologic dysfunction, and/or pain. Currently, the only effective management strategy is surgical resection. Converging evidence has demonstrated that the NF1 tumor suppressor protein, neurofibromin, negatively regulates activity in the mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathway. We employed a 2-strata clinical trial design. Stratum 1 included subjects with inoperable, NF1-associated progressive PN and sought to determine whether sirolimus safely and tolerably increases time to progression (TTP). Volumetric MRI analysis conducted at regular intervals was used to determine TTP relative to baseline imaging. The estimated median TTP of subjects receiving sirolimus was 15.4 months (95% CI: 14.3-23.7 mo), which was significantly longer than 11.9 months (P < .001), the median TTP of the placebo arm of a previous PN clinical trial with similar eligibility criteria. This study demonstrated that sirolimus prolongs TTP by almost 4 months in patients with NF1-associated progressive PN. Although the improvement in TTP is modest, given the lack of significant or frequent toxicity and the availability of few other treatment options, the use of sirolimus to slow the growth of progressive PN could be considered in select patients.;;Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that arise in one-third of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

These aggressive malignancies confer poor survival, with no effective therapy available. We present the generation and characterization of five distinct MPNST orthoxenograft models for preclinical testing and personalized medicine. Four of the models are patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX), two independent MPNSTs from the same NF1 patient and two from different sporadic patients. The fifth model is an orthoxenograft derived from an NF1-related MPNST cell line. All MPNST orthoxenografts were generated by tumor implantation, or cell line injection, next to the sciatic nerve of nude mice, and were perpetuated by 7-10 mouse-to-mouse passages. The models reliably recapitulate the histopathological properties of their parental primary tumors. They also mimic distal dissemination properties in mice. Human stroma was rapidly lost after MPNST engraftment and replaced by murine stroma, which facilitated genomic tumor characterization. Compatible with an origin in a catastrophic event and subsequent genome stabilization, MPNST contained highly altered genomes that remained remarkably stable in orthoxenograft establishment and along passages. Mutational frequency and type of somatic point mutations were highly variable among the different MPNSTs modeled, but very consistent when comparing primary tumors with matched orthoxenografts generated. Unsupervised cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) using an MPNST expression signature of ~1,000 genes grouped together all primary tumor-orthoxenograft pairs. Our work points to differences in the engraftment process of primary tumors compared with the engraftment of established cell lines. Following standardization and extensive characterization and validation, the orthoxenograft models were used for initial preclinical drug testing. Sorafenib (a BRAF inhibitor), in combination with doxorubicin or rapamycin, was found to be the most effective treatment for reducing MPNST growth. The development of genomically well-characterized preclinical models for MPNST allowed the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies for personalized medicine. ;;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft-tissue sarcomas that can arise either sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have improved the ability to detect these molecular aberrations with greater sensitivity. However, integrating them into clinical management in an individualized manner has proven challenging. To evaluate the use of integrative clinical sequencing and genetic counseling in the assessment and treatment of children and young adults with cancer. Single-site, observational, consecutive case series (May 2012-October 2014) involving 102 children and young adults (mean age, 10.6 years; median age, 11.5 years, range, 0-22 years) with relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer. Participants underwent integrative clinical exome (tumor and germline DNA) and transcriptome (tumor RNA) sequencing and genetic counseling. Results were discussed by a precision medicine tumor board, which made recommendations to families and their physicians. Proportion of patients with potentially actionable findings, results of clinical actions based on integrative clinical sequencing, and estimated proportion of patients or their families at risk of future cancer. Of the 104 screened patients, 102 enrolled with 91 (89%) having adequate tumor tissue to complete sequencing. Only the 91 patients were included in all calculations, including 28 (31%) with hematological malignancies and 63 (69%) with solid tumors. Forty-two patients (46%) had actionable findings that changed their cancer management: 15 of 28 (54%) with hematological malignancies and 27 of 63 (43%) with solid tumors. Individualized actions were taken in 23 of the 91 (25%) based on actionable integrative clinical sequencing findings, including change in treatment for 14 patients (15%) and genetic counseling for future risk for 9 patients (10%). Nine of 91 (10%) of the personalized clinical interventions resulted in ongoing partial clinical remission of 8 to 16 months or helped sustain complete clinical remission of 6 to 21 months. All 9 patients and families with actionable incidental genetic findings agreed to genetic counseling and screening. In this single-center case series involving young patients with relapsed or refractory cancer, incorporation of integrative clinical sequencing data into clinical management was feasible, revealed potentially actionable findings in 46% of patients, and was associated with change in treatment and family genetic counseling for a small proportion of patients. The lack of a control group limited assessing whether better clinical outcomes resulted from this approach than outcomes that would have occurred with standard care.;;Cancer is caused by a diverse array of somatic and germline genomic aberrations. Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have improved the ability to detect these molecular aberrations with greater sensitivity. However, integrating them into clinical management in an individualized manner has proven challenging. To evaluate the use of integrative clinical sequencing and genetic counseling in the assessment and treatment of children and young adults with cancer. Single-site, observational, consecutive case series (May 2012-October 2014) involving 102 children and young adults (mean age, 10.6 years; median age, 11.5 years, range, 0-22 years) with relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer. Participants underwent integrative clinical exome (tumor and germline DNA) and transcriptome (tumor RNA) sequencing and genetic counseling. Results were discussed by a precision medicine tumor board, which made recommendations to families and their physicians.

To gain additional insights into this difference, we performed a genome-scale pooled shRNA enhancer screen in a BRAF-mutant, RAF inhibitor-resistant colorectal cancer cell line exposed to the selective RAF inhibitor PLX4720. We identified multiple genes along the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling axis that, when suppressed, either genetically or pharmacologically, sensitized cells to the selective RAF inhibitor through sustained inhibition of MAPK signaling. Strikingly, CRAF was a key mediator of resistance that could be overcome by the use of pan-RAF inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the combination of pan-RAF and MEK inhibitors displayed strong synergy in melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines with RAS-activating events such as RTK activation, KRAS mutation, or NF1 loss-of-function mutations. Combinations of selective RAF inhibitors, such as PLX4720 or dabrafenib, with MEK inhibitors did not incur such profound synergy, suggesting that inhibition of CRAF by pan-RAF inhibitors plays a key role in determining cellular response. Importantly, in contrast to the modest activity seen with single-agent treatment, dual pan-RAF and MEK inhibition results in the induction of apoptosis, greatly enhancing efficacy. Notably, combined pan-RAF and MEK inhibition can overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to single-agent RAF/MEK inhibition, supporting dual pan-RAF and MEK inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for BRAF- and KRAS-mutant cancers.;;RAF and MEK inhibitors are effective in BRAF-mutant melanoma but not in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus.

This case highlights the therapeutic success of a MEK inhibitor in neurofibromatosis-associated glioblastoma. As a corollary, this should prompt evaluation of MEK inhibitors in tumours associated with neurofibromatosis.

A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair. Toxicity in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar to that reported previously in those without such mutations. AstraZeneca.;;Oral administration of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide at low doses, metronomic dosing, is well tolerated, with efficacy in multiple tumor types. PARP inhibition potentiates effects of cyclophosphamide in preclinical models. We conducted a phase I trial of the PARP inhibitor veliparib and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies. Objectives were to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination; characterize veliparib pharmacokinetics (PK); measure poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), a product of PARP, in tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); and measure the DNA-damage marker γH2AX in PBMCs and circulating tumor cells (CTC). Cyclophosphamide was administered once daily in 21-day cycles in combination with veliparib administered once daily for 7, 14, or 21 days. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The study treatment was well tolerated, and the MTD was established as veliparib 60 mg with cyclophosphamide 50 mg given once daily. Seven patients had partial responses; an additional six patients had disease stabilization for at least six cycles. PAR was significantly decreased in PBMCs (by at least 50%) and tumor biopsies (by at least 80%) across dose levels (DL); γH2AX levels were increased in CTCs from seven of nine patients evaluated after drug administration. The combination of veliparib with metronomic cyclophosphamide is well tolerated and shows promising activity in a subset of patients with BRCA mutations. A phase II trial of the combination compared with single-agent cyclophosphamide is ongoing in BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and low-grade lymphoma.,,;;Tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in a complex gene network that regulates homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Disruption of the BRCA-network through gene mutation, deletion, or RNAi-mediated silencing can sensitize cells to small molecule inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi). Here, we demonstrate that BRCA-network disruption in the presence of PARPi leads to the selective induction and enhancement of interferon pathway and apoptotic gene expression in cultured tumor cells. In addition, we report PARPi cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient tumor cells is enhanced >10-fold when combined with interferon-γ. These findings establish a link between synthetic lethality of PARPi in BRCA-network disrupted cells and interferon pathway activation triggered by genetic instability.;;Our objective was to determine the rate of BRCA1/2 deficiency in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumors from a cohort of unselect patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOH). BRCA1/2 mutation analysis was performed in 29 patients with platinum-sensitive EOC and 24 patients with platinum-resistant disease. Germline DNA was analyzed in mutation carriers when normal tissue was available. BRCA expression was ascertained by quantitative rt-PCR. Associations between BRCA mutation status and expression levels and parameters of platinum response were analyzed. Fifteen of 53 (28.3%) EOC tumors had BRCA1/2 mutations. Twelve mutations were in BRCA1, while 3 involved BRCA2. Of the 12 mutation-carriers with normal tissue available for DNA analyses, 33.3% of the mutations were found to be somatic. Three mutations were novel. The majority of BRCA mutations (73%) were identified in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. In total, 38% of platinum-sensitive tumors were found to have a BRCA mutation, compared to 17% of the platinum-resistant patients. A statistical trend toward platinum-sensitive disease was seen in BRCA mutation carriers (p=0.079). Nineteen (36%) study patients had some form of BRCA deficiency, and these patients were less likely to have platinum-resistant tumors (OR=0.29; p value=0.048). BRCA mutations occurred more frequently in platinum-sensitive EOC than platinum-resistant disease. The high overall frequency of BRCA deficiency in EOC underscores the importance of tumor profiling as therapies targeting the DNA repair pathway are being investigated.,,The frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations in women with ovarian cancer is unclear; reports vary from 3% to 27%. The impact of germ-line mutation on response requires further investigation to understand its impact on treatment planning and clinical trial design. Women with nonmucinous ovarian carcinoma (n = 1,001) enrolled onto a population-based, case-control study were screened for point mutations and large deletions in both genes. Survival outcomes and responses to multiple lines of chemotherapy were assessed. Germ-line mutations were found in 14.1% of patients overall, including 16.6% of serous cancer patients (high-gradeserous, 17.1%); [corrected] 44% had no reported family history of breast orovarian cancer.Patients carrying germ-line mutations had improved rates of progression-free and overall survival. In the relapse setting, patients carrying mutations more frequently responded to both platin- and nonplatin-based regimens than mutation-negative patients, even in patients with early relapse after primary treatment. Mutation-negative patients who responded to multiple cycles of platin-based treatment were more likely to carry somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. BRCA mutation status has a major influence on survival in ovarian cancer patients and should be an additional stratification factor in clinical trials. Treatment outcomes in BRCA1/2 carriers challenge conventional definitions of platin resistance, and mutation status may be able to contribute to decision making and systemic therapy selection in the relapse setting. Our data, together with the advent of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor trials, supports the recommendation that germ-line BRCA1/2 testing should be offered to all women diagnosed with nonmucinous, ovarian carcinoma, regardless of family history.;;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of malignancies and a major health burden. We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal rearrangements leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known to be important in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and new candidate drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence. Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA damage repair deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals with these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded. ;;The identification of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are expected to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy is of interest. We conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial of single-agent platinum for mTNBC with biomarker correlates. Patients with mTNBC received first- or second-line cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6) by physician's choice once every 3 weeks. Coprimary end points were objective response rate (RR) and response prediction by p63/p73 gene expression. Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not. Five of the six long-term responders alive at a median of 4.5 years lacked germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and two of them had increased tumor HRD-LOH/HRD-LST scores. Platinum agents are active in mTNBC, especially in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A measure of tumor DNA repair function may identify patients without mutations who could benefit from platinum therapy agents. Prospective controlled confirmatory trials are warranted.;;Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01682772; Cancer Research UK number, CRUK/11/029.).,,,,;;Cisplatin is synergistic with vinorelbine and the PARP inhibitor veliparib, and has antineoplastic activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer. This phase I study assessed veliparib with cisplatin and vinorelbine. A 3+3 dose-escalation design evaluated veliparib administered twice daily for 14 days with cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) day 1) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) days 1, 8) every 21 days, for 6 to 10 cycles, followed by veliparib monotherapy. Pharmacokinetics, measurement of poly(ADP-ribose) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and preliminary efficacy were assessed. IHC and gene-expression profiling were evaluated as potential predictors of response. Forty-five patients enrolled in nine dose cohorts plus five in an expansion cohort at the highest dose level and recommended phase II dose, 300 mg twice daily. The MTD of veliparib was not reached. Neutropenia (36%), anemia (30%), and thrombocytopenia (12%) were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events. Best overall response for 48 patients was radiologic response with 9-week confirmation for 17 (35%; 2 complete, 15 partial), and stable disease for 21 (44%). Germline BRCA mutation presence versus absence was associated with 6-month progression-free survival [PFS; 10 of 14 (71%) vs. 8 of 27 (30%), mid-P = 0.01]. Median PFS for all 50 patients was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval, 4.1-6.7). Veliparib at 300 mg twice daily combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine is well tolerated with encouraging response rates. A phase II randomized trial is planned to assess veliparib's contribution to cisplatin chemotherapy in metastatic TNBC and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(12); 2855-64. ©2016 AACR.;;PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade provides significant clinical benefits for melanoma patients. We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We find that overall high mutational loads associate with improved survival, and tumors from responding patients are enriched for mutations in the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer. These findings suggest that attenuating the biological processes that underlie IPRES may improve anti-PD-1 response in melanoma and other cancer types.	;;;;Tutt A. et al.,Lancet,2010;;Kummar S. et al.,Clin.

We aimed to assess its efficacy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with previous treatment failure on EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. In this phase 2b/3 trial, we enrolled patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (ECOG) performance score of 0-2 who had received one or two previous chemotherapy regimens and had disease progression after at least 12 weeks of treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. We used a computer-generated sequence to randomly allocate patients (2:1) to either afatinib (50 mg per day) or placebo; all patients received best supportive care. Randomisation was done in blocks of three and was stratified by sex and baseline ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Investigators, patients, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (from date of randomisation to death), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00656136. Between May 26, 2008, and Sept 21, 2009, we identified 697 patients, 585 of whom were randomly allocated to treatment (390 to afatinib, 195 to placebo). Median overall survival was 10·8 months (95% CI 10·0-12·0) in the afatinib group and 12·0 months (10·2-14·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% CI 0·86-1·35; p=0·74). Median progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group (3·3 months, 95% CI 2·79-4·40) than it was in the placebo group (1·1 months, 0·95-1·68; hazard ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·31-0·48; p<0·0001). No complete responses to treatment were noted; 29 (7%) patients had a partial response in the afatinib group, as did one patient in the placebo group. Subsequent cancer treatment was given to 257 (68%) patients in the afatinib group and 153 (79%) patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the afatinib group were diarrhoea (339 [87%] of 390 patients; 66 [17%] were grade 3) and rash or acne (305 [78%] patients; 56 [14%] were grade 3). These events occurred less often in the placebo group (18 [9%] of 195 patients had diarrhoea; 31 [16%] had rash or acne), all being grade 1 or 2. Drug-related serious adverse events occurred in 39 (10%) patients in the afatinib group and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group. We recorded two possibly treatment-related deaths in the afatinib group. Although we recorded no benefit in terms of overall survival with afatinib (which might have been affected by cancer treatments given after progression in both groups), our findings for progression-free survival and response to treatment suggest that afatinib could be of some benefit to patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who have failed at least 12 weeks of previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. Boehringer Ingelheim Inc.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.;;EGFR-mutant lung cancers responsive to reversible EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib/erlotinib) develop acquired resistance, mediated by second-site EGFR T790M mutation in >50% of cases. Preclinically, afatinib (irreversible ErbB family blocker) plus cetuximab (anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) overcomes T790M-mediated resistance. This phase Ib study combining afatinib and cetuximab enrolled heavily pretreated patients with advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancer and acquired resistance to erlotinib/gefitinib. Patients provided post-acquired-resistance tumor samples for profiling EGFR mutations. Among 126 patients, objective response rate (overall 29%) was comparable in T790M-positive and T790M-negative tumors (32% vs. 25%; P = 0.341). Median progression-free survival was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.3-6.4), and the median duration of confirmed objective response was 5.7 months (range, 1.8-24.4). Therapy-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 44%/2% of patients. Afatinib-cetuximab demonstrated robust clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, both with and without T790M mutations, warranting further investigation. This article reports the results of a trial combining afatinib and cetuximab in patients with acquired resistance and details the first clinical proof-of-concept for the preclinical hypothesis that a significant proportion of tumors in patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib remain dependent on EGFR signaling for survival.;;In this phase Ib/II study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of afatinib plus nimotuzumab (N) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. In phase Ib stage, patients received afatinib (40 mg or 30 mg once daily) plus nimotuzumab (100 mg or 200 mg once weekly) for 28-day cycles to determine the recommended phase II dose (RPIID). The safety and efficacy of RPIID dose was evaluated in phase II stage. In total, 50 patients were enrolled (13 to phase Ib and 37 to phase II). In the first dose-finding cohort (afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 100 mg), one patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 diarrhea and in the subsequent cohort (afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 200 mg), two DLTs (grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 neutropenia) occurred in 2 of 6 patients. Accordingly, RPIID was determined as afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 100 mg. In 44 patients treated with RPIID, 7 (16%) patients had grade 3 toxicities; skin rash (7%), diarrhea (5%), acne (2%), and fatigue (2%). The overall response rate was 23% and the median duration of response was 4.3 months (range, 0.7-16.2 months). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-5.7 months] and 11.7 months (95% CI, 9.4-14.0 months), respectively. Combination treatment of afatinib and nimotuzumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity in advanced NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. Larger phase III trial is warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety.

Several drugs directed at inhibiting BCL-2 and related antiapoptotic proteins have been tested clinically, with some showing considerable promise, particularly in lymphoid malignancies. A better understanding of the BCL-2 family has also provided insight into how conventional chemotherapy selectively kills cancer cells and why some cancers are more chemosensitive than others.

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.	Verbeek HH. et al.,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2011;;Verbeek HH. et al.,J. Clin.

To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.;;Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification.

L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.	Bose R. et al.,Cancer Discov,2013;;Bose R. et al.,Cancer Discov,2013

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.	Bresler SC. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2011

GDC-0449, a drug that inhibits Hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor Smoothened (SMO), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. To evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to GDC-0449, we determined the mutational status of Hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. We identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of SMO that had no effect on Hh signaling but disrupted the ability of GDC-0449 to bind SMO and suppress this pathway. A mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a GDC-0449-resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. These findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a G protein-coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.,,Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors are under clinical investigation for the treatment of several cancers. Vismodegib is approved for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Most BCC patients experience significant clinical benefit on vismodegib, but some develop resistance. Genomic analysis of tumor biopsies revealed that vismodegib resistance is associated with Hedgehog (Hh) pathway reactivation, predominantly through mutation of the drug target SMO and to a lesser extent through concurrent copy number changes in SUFU and GLI2. SMO mutations either directly impaired drug binding or activated SMO to varying levels. Furthermore, we found evidence for intra-tumor heterogeneity, suggesting that a combination of therapies targeting components at multiple levels of the Hh pathway is required to overcome resistance.;;Advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) frequently acquire resistance to Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors through unknown mechanisms. Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

This study aimed to determine the levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and the therapeutic potential of MLN8237, an investigational AURKA inhibitor, alone and in combination with cisplatin. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we detected frequent AURKA gene amplification (15 of 34, 44%) and mRNA overexpression (37 of 44, 84%) in esophageal adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of AURKA in more than two-thirds of esophageal adenocarcinoma tissue samples (92 of 132, 70%; P < 0.001). Using FLO-1, OE19, and OE33 esophageal adenocarinoma cell lines, with constitutive AURKA overexpression and mutant p53, we observed inhibition of colony formation with a single treatment of 0.5 μmol/L MLN8237 (P < 0.05). This effect was further enhanced in combination with 2.5 μmol/L cisplatin (P < 0.001). Twenty-four hours after treatment with the MLN8237 or MLN8237 and cisplatin, cell-cycle analyses showed a sharp increase in the percentage of polyploid cells (P < 0.001). This was followed by an increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G(1) phase at 72 hours, concordant with the occurrence of cell death (P < 0.001). Western blot analysis showed higher induction of TAp73β, PUMA, NOXA, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP with the combined treatment, as compared with a single-agent treatment. Using xenograft models, we showed an enhanced antitumor role for the MLN8237 and cisplatin combination, as compared with single-agent treatments (P < 0.001). In conclusion, this study shows frequent overexpression of AURKA and suggests that MLN8237 could be an effective antitumor agent, which can be combined with cisplatin for a better therapeutic outcome in esophageal adenocarcinomas.,,Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive subtype of prostate cancer that most commonly evolves from preexisting prostate adenocarcinoma (PCA). Using Next Generation RNA-sequencing and oligonucleotide arrays, we profiled 7 NEPC, 30 PCA, and 5 benign prostate tissue (BEN), and validated findings on tumors from a large cohort of patients (37 NEPC, 169 PCA, 22 BEN) using IHC and FISH. We discovered significant overexpression and gene amplification of AURKA and MYCN in 40% of NEPC and 5% of PCA, respectively, and evidence that that they cooperate to induce a neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cells. There was dramatic and enhanced sensitivity of NEPC (and MYCN overexpressing PCA) to Aurora kinase inhibitor therapy both in vitro and in vivo, with complete suppression of neuroendocrine marker expression following treatment. We propose that alterations in Aurora kinase A and N-myc are involved in the development of NEPC, and future clinical trials will help determine from the efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor therapy. We report on the largest in-depth molecular analysis of NEPC and provide new insight into molecular events involved in the progression of prostate cancer.	Sehdev V. et al.,Mol.

This seminal finding also highlighted our sparse knowledge about key signalling pathways in colorectal tumours. Drugs that inhibit oncogenic alterations such as phospho-MAP2K (also called MEK), phospho-AKT, and mutant B-RAF seem promising as single treatment or when given with EGFR inhibitors. However, our understanding of the precise role these potential drug targets have in colorectal tumours, and the oncogenic dependence that tumours might have on these components, has not progressed at the same rate. As a result, patient selection and prediction of treatment effects remain problematic. We review the role of mutations in genes other than KRAS on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, and discuss strategies to target these oncogenic alterations alone or in combination with receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibition.,,PTEN, AKT, and KRAS are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) downstream regulators. KRAS mutations confer resistance to cetuximab. This retrospective study investigated the role of PTEN loss, AKT phosphorylation, and KRAS mutations on the activity of cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A cohort of patients with irinotecan-refractory mCRC who were treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan was tested for PTEN immunoreactivity (ie, immunohistochemistry; IHC), pAKT IHC, and KRAS mutations. Analyses were performed both on primary tumors and on related metastases, and the association among IHC, mutational results, and treatment outcomes was investigated. One-hundred two patients were eligible. Ninety-six primary tumors, 59 metastases, and 53 paired samples were available. Forty-nine primary tumors (58% of assessable samples) had a preserved PTEN expression (PTEN-positive), whereas 35 (40% of assessable samples) were pAKT-positive. Levels of concordance between primary tumors and metastases were 60%, 68%, and 95% for PTEN, pAKT, and KRAS, respectively. PTEN status on primary tumors and pAKT status both on primary tumors and on metastases did not predict response or progression-free survival (PFS). On metastases, 12 (36%) of 33 patients with PTEN-positive tumors were responders compared with one (5%) of 22 who had PTEN-negative tumors (P = .007). The median PFS of patients with PTEN-positive metastases was 4.7 months compared with 3.3 months for those with PTEN-negative metastases (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; P = .005). Patients with PTEN-positive metastases and KRAS wild type had longer PFS compared with other patients (5.5 months v 3.8 months; HR, 0.42; P = .001). PTEN loss in metastases may be predictive of resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan. The combination of PTEN IHC and KRAS mutational analyses could help to identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who have higher chances of benefiting from EGFR inhibition.;;The discovery of mutant KRAS as a predictor of resistance to epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies brought a major change in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

The aim of the study was to test the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor MK2206 for thyroid cancer. We examined the effects of MK2206 on thyroid cancer cells with respect to the genotypes of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Proliferation of thyroid cancer cells OCUT1, K1, FTC133, C643, Hth7, and TPC1, which harbored PIK3CA, PTEN, Ras, or RET/PTC mutations that could activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, was potently inhibited by MK2206 with IC(50) values mostly below or around 0.5 μm. In contrast, no potent inhibition by MK2206 was seen in most of the Hth74, KAT18, SW1736, WRO, and TAD2 cells that did not harbor mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. The inhibition efficacy was also genetic-selective. Specifically, the average inhibition efficacies were 59.2 ± 11.3 vs. 36.4 ± 8.8% (P = 0.005) at 1 μm MK2206 and 64.4 ± 11.5 vs. 38.5 ± 18.9% (P = 0.02) at 3 μm MK2206 for cells with mutations vs. cells without. The SW1736 cell, lacking mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, had minimal response to MK2206, but transfection with exogenous PIK3CA mutants, PIK3CA H1047R and E545K, significantly increased its sensitivity to MK2206. MK2206 also completely overcame the feedback activation of Akt from temsirolimus-induced mammalian target of rapamycin suppression, and the two inhibitors synergistically inhibited thyroid cancer cell growth. Our study demonstrates a genetic selectivity of MK2206 in inhibiting thyroid cancer cells by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, supporting a clinical trial in thyroid cancer.,,The aim of this study was to show preclinical efficacy and clinical development potential of PKI-587, a dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor. In vitro class 1 PI3K enzyme and human tumor cell growth inhibition assays and in vivo five tumor xenograft models were used to show efficacy. In vitro, PKI-587 potently inhibited class I PI3Ks (IC(50) vs. PI3K-α = 0.4 nmol/L), PI3K-α mutants, and mTOR. PKI-587 inhibited growth of 50 diverse human tumor cell lines at IC(50) values of less than 100 nmol/L. PKI-587 suppressed phosphorylation of PI3K/mTOR effectors (e.g., Akt), and induced apoptosis in human tumor cell lines with elevated PI3K/mTOR signaling. MDA-MB-361 [breast; HER2(+), PIK3CA mutant (E545K)] was particularly sensitive to this effect, with cleaved PARP, an apoptosis marker, induced by 30 nmol/L PKI-587 at 4 hours. In vivo, PKI-587 inhibited tumor growth in breast (MDA-MB-361, BT474), colon (HCT116), lung (H1975), and glioma (U87MG) xenograft models. In MDA-MB-361 tumors, PKI-587 (25 mg/kg, single dose i.v.) suppressed Akt phosphorylation [at threonine(T)308 and serine(S)473] for up to 36 hours, with cleaved PARP (cPARP) evident up to 18 hours. PKI-587 at 25 mg/kg (once weekly) shrank large (∼1,000 mm(3)) MDA-MB-361 tumors and suppressed tumor regrowth. Tumor regression correlated with suppression of phosphorylated Akt in the MDA-MB-361 model. PKI-587 also caused regression in other tumor models, and efficacy was enhanced when given in combination with PD0325901 (MEK 1/2 inhibitor), irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor), or HKI-272 (neratinib, HER2 inhibitor). Significant antitumor efficacy and a favorable pharmacokinetic/safety profile justified phase 1 clinical evaluation of PKI-587.,,AKT is frequently deregulated in cancer, making it an attractive anticancer drug target. CCT128930 is a novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor discovered using fragment- and structure-based approaches. It is a potent, advanced lead pyrrolopyrimidine compound exhibiting selectivity for AKT over PKA, achieved by targeting a single amino acid difference. CCT128930 exhibited marked antiproliferative activity and inhibited the phosphorylation of a range of AKT substrates in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro, consistent with AKT inhibition. CCT128930 caused a G(1) arrest in PTEN-null U87MG human glioblastoma cells, consistent with AKT pathway blockade. Pharmacokinetic studies established that potentially active concentrations of CCT128930 could be achieved in human tumor xenografts. Furthermore, CCT128930 also blocked the phosphorylation of several downstream AKT biomarkers in U87MG tumor xenografts, indicating AKT inhibition in vivo. Antitumor activity was observed with CCT128930 in U87MG and HER2-positive, PIK3CA-mutant BT474 human breast cancer xenografts, consistent with its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. A quantitative immunofluorescence assay to measure the phosphorylation and total protein expression of the AKT substrate PRAS40 in hair follicles is presented. Significant decreases in pThr246 PRAS40 occurred in CCT128930-treated mouse whisker follicles in vivo and human hair follicles treated ex vivo, with minimal changes in total PRAS40. In conclusion, CCT128930 is a novel, selective, and potent AKT inhibitor that blocks AKT activity in vitro and in vivo and induces marked antitumor responses. We have also developed a novel biomarker assay for the inhibition of AKT in human hair follicles, which is currently being used in clinical trials.,,We have shown previously that blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cooperates with a pan-selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in EGFR-driven glioma. In this communication, we tested EGFR-driven glioma differing in PTEN status, treating with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and a novel dual inhibitor of PI3Kalpha and mTOR (PI-103). Erlotinib blocked proliferation only in PTEN(wt) cells expressing EGFR. Although erlotinib monotherapy showed little effect in PTEN(mt) glioma, PI-103 greatly augmented the antiproliferative efficacy of erlotinib in this setting. To address the importance of PI3K blockade, we showed in PTEN(mt) glioma that combining PI-103 and erlotinib was superior to either monotherapy or to therapy combining erlotinib with either rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) or PIK-90 (an inhibitor of PI3Kalpha). These experiments show that a dual inhibitor of PI3Kalpha and mTOR augments the activity of EGFR blockade, offering a mechanistic rationale for targeting EGFR, PI3Kalpha, and mTOR in the treatment of EGFR-driven, PTEN-mutant glioma.,,Class 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in cell proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. Here, we investigated biomarker strategies for PI3K pathway inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Molecular profiling for candidate PI3K predictive biomarkers was conducted on a collection of NSCLC tumor samples. Assays included comparative genomic hybridization, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction gene expression, mutation detection for PIK3CA and other oncogenes, PTEN immunohistochemistry, and FISH for PIK3CA copy number. In addition, a panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized for alterations in the PI3K pathway was screened with PI3K and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to assess the preclinical predictive value of candidate biomarkers. PIK3CA amplification was detected in 37% of squamous tumors and 5% of adenocarcinomas, whereas PIK3CA mutations were found in 9% of squamous and 0% of adenocarcinomas. Total loss of PTEN immunostaining was found in 21% of squamous tumors and 4% of adenocarcinomas. Cell lines harboring pathway alterations (receptor tyrosine kinase activation, PI3K mutation or amplification, and PTEN loss) were exquisitely sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor had broader activity across the cell line panel and in tumor xenografts. The combination of GDC-0941 with paclitaxel, erlotinib, or a mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor had greater effects on cell viability than PI3K inhibition alone. Candidate biomarkers for PI3K inhibitors have predictive value in preclinical models and show histology-specific alterations in primary tumors, suggesting that distinct biomarker strategies may be required in squamous compared with nonsquamous NSCLC patient populations.,,The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is commonly dysregulated in human cancer, making it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapeutics. We have used a mouse model of ovarian cancer generated by Kras(G12D) activation and Pten deletion in the ovarian surface epithelium for the preclinical assessment of a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502. To enable higher throughput studies, we developed an orthotopic primary transplant model from these mice and evaluated therapeutic response to PF-04691502 using small-animal ultrasound and FDG-PET imaging. PF-04691502 inhibited tumor growth at 7 days by 72% ± 9. FDG-PET imaging revealed that PF-04691502 reduced glucose metabolism dramatically, suggesting FDG-PET may be exploited as an imaging biomarker of target inhibition by PF-04691502. Tissue biomarkers of PI3K/mTOR pathway activity, p-AKT (S473), and p-RPS6 (S240/244), were also dramatically inhibited following PF-04691502 treatment. However, as a single agent, PF-04691502 did not induce tumor regression and the long-term efficacy was limited, with tumor proliferation continuing in the presence of drug treatment. We hypothesized that tumor progression was because of concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway downstream of Kras(G12D) expression promoting cell survival and that the therapeutic effect of PF-04691502 would be enhanced by combinatory inhibition of MEK using PD-0325901. This combination induced striking tumor regression, apoptosis associated with upregulation of Bim and downregulation of Mcl-1, and greatly improved duration of survival. These data suggest that contemporaneous MEK inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity associated with abrogation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, converting tumor growth inhibition to tumor regression in a mouse model of ovarian cancer driven by PTEN loss and mutant K-Ras.,,The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in human cancers, and mTOR is a clinically validated target. mTOR forms two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which regulate cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Rapamycin and its analogues partially inhibit mTOR through allosteric binding to mTORC1, but not mTORC2, and have shown clinical utility in certain cancers. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of OSI-027, a selective and potent dual inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 with biochemical IC(50) values of 22 nmol/L and 65 nmol/L, respectively. OSI-027 shows more than 100-fold selectivity for mTOR relative to PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and DNA-PK. OSI-027 inhibits phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K1 as well as the mTORC2 substrate AKT in diverse cancer models in vitro and in vivo. OSI-027 and OXA-01 (close analogue of OSI-027) potently inhibit proliferation of several rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive nonengineered and engineered cancer cell lines and also, induce cell death in tumor cell lines with activated PI3K-AKT signaling. OSI-027 shows concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and AKT in tumor tissue with resulting tumor growth inhibition. OSI-027 shows robust antitumor activity in several different human xenograft models representing various histologies. Furthermore, in COLO 205 and GEO colon cancer xenograft models, OSI-027 shows superior efficacy compared with rapamycin. Our results further support the important role of mTOR as a driver of tumor growth and establish OSI-027 as a potent anticancer agent. OSI-027 is currently in phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.,,We describe the preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of GDC-0068, a novel highly selective ATP-competitive pan-Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers. The effect of GDC-0068 on Akt signaling was characterized using specific biomarkers of the Akt pathway, and response to GDC-0068 was evaluated in human cancer cell lines and xenograft models with various genetic backgrounds, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. GDC-0068 blocked Akt signaling both in cultured human cancer cell lines and in tumor xenograft models as evidenced by dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of downstream targets. Inhibition of Akt activity by GDC-0068 resulted in blockade of cell-cycle progression and reduced viability of cancer cell lines. Markers of Akt activation, including high-basal phospho-Akt levels, PTEN loss, and PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, correlate with sensitivity to GDC-0068. Isogenic PTEN knockout also sensitized MCF10A cells to GDC-0068. In multiple tumor xenograft models, oral administration of GDC-0068 resulted in antitumor activity ranging from tumor growth delay to regression. Consistent with the role of Akt in a survival pathway, GDC-0068 also enhanced antitumor activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents. GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally bioavailable Akt kinase inhibitor that shows pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our preclinical data provide a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate GDC-0068 in cancers with activated Akt signaling.,,Alterations of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway occur broadly in cancer via multiple mechanisms including mutation of the PIK3CA gene, loss or mutation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes. The dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in tumor initiation, cell growth and survival, invasion and angiogenesis, thus, PI3K and mTOR are promising therapeutic targets for cancer. We discovered GDC-0980, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Class I PI3 kinase and mTOR kinase (TORC1/2) with excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutical properties. GDC-0980 potently inhibits signal transduction downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, as measured by pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, thereby acting upon two key pathway nodes to produce the strongest attainable inhibition of signaling in the pathway. Correspondingly, GDC-0980 was potent across a broad panel of cancer cell lines, with the greatest potency in breast, prostate, and lung cancers and less activity in melanoma and pancreatic cancers, consistent with KRAS and BRAF acting as resistance markers. Treatment of cancer cell lines with GDC-0980 resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, and in contrast to mTOR inhibitors, GDC-0980 induced apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, including those with direct pathway activation via PI3K and PTEN. Low doses of GDC-0980 potently inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models including those with activated PI3K, loss of LKB1 or PTEN, and elicited an exposure-related decrease in PD biomarkers. These preclinical data show that GDC-0980 is a potent and effective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with promise for the clinic.,,The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is frequently activated in endometrial cancer through various PI3K/AKT-activating genetic alterations. We examined the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235--a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor--and RAD001--an mTOR inhibitor--in 13 endometrial cancer cell lines, all of which possess one or more alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and K-Ras. We also combined these compounds with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (PD98059 or UO126) in cell lines with K-Ras alterations (mutations or amplification). PTEN mutant cell lines without K-Ras alterations (n = 9) were more sensitive to both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 than were cell lines with K-Ras alterations (n = 4). Dose-dependent growth suppression was more drastically induced by NVP-BEZ235 than by RAD001 in the sensitive cell lines. G1 arrest was induced by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner. We observed in vivo antitumor activity of both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 in nude mice. The presence of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or UO126, sensitized the K-Ras mutant cells to NVP-BEZ235. Robust growth suppression by NVP-BEZ235 suggests that a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic for endometrial carcinomas. Our data suggest that mutational statuses of PTEN and K-Ras might be useful predictors of sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235 in certain endometrial carcinomas.,,Aberrant activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays an important role in breast cancer progression and represents a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. In this study, we report the impact of the investigational drug MLN0128, a potent and selective small molecule active-site TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor, on tumor growth and metastasis using human breast cancer xenograft models. We assessed in vitro antiproliferative activity of MLN0128 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We next evaluated the impact of MLN0128 on tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis using mammary fat pad xenograft models of a non-VEGF (ML20) and a VEGF-driven (MV165) MCF-7 sublines harboring PIK3CA mutations. MLN0128 potently inhibited cell proliferation in various breast cancer cell lines harboring PIK3CA (IC(50): 1.5-53 nM), PTEN (IC(50): 1-149 nM), KRAS, and/or BRAF mutations (IC(50): 13-162 nM), and in human endothelial cells (IC(50): 33-40 nM) in vitro. In vivo, MLN0128 decreased primary tumor growth significantly in both non-VEGF (ML20; p = 0.05) and VEGF-driven MCF-7 (MV165; p = 0.014) xenograft models. MLN0128 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, S6, 4E-BP1, and NDRG1 in both models. In contrast, rapamycin increased Akt activity and failed to reduce the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, PRAS40, and NDRG1. VEGF-induced lung metastasis in MV165 is inhibited by MLN0128 and rapamycin. In conclusion, MLN0128 inhibits TORC1/2-dependent signaling in preclinical models of breast cancer. MLN0128 appears to be superior in blocking mTORC1/2 signaling in contrast to rapamycin. Our findings support the clinical research of MLN0128 in patients with breast cancer and metastasis.,,We tested the hypothesis that allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206 inhibits tumor growth, and that PTEN/PIK3CA mutations confer MK-2206 sensitivity. MK-2206 effects on cell signaling were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity. Stable transfection of PIK3CA E545K or H1047R mutant plasmids into normal-like MCF10A breast cells enhanced MK-2206 sensitivity. Cell lines that were less sensitive to MK-2206 had lower ratios of Akt1/Akt2 and had less growth inhibition with Akt siRNA knockdown. In PTEN-mutant ZR75-1 breast cancer xenografts, MK-2206 treatment inhibited Akt signaling, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206-sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.;;The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is widely postulated to be an effective therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. The aim of the study was to test the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor MK2206 for thyroid cancer. We examined the effects of MK2206 on thyroid cancer cells with respect to the genotypes of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Proliferation of thyroid cancer cells OCUT1, K1, FTC133, C643, Hth7, and TPC1, which harbored PIK3CA, PTEN, Ras, or RET/PTC mutations that could activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, was potently inhibited by MK2206 with IC(50) values mostly below or around 0.5 μm. In contrast, no potent inhibition by MK2206 was seen in most of the Hth74, KAT18, SW1736, WRO, and TAD2 cells that did not harbor mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. The inhibition efficacy was also genetic-selective. Specifically, the average inhibition efficacies were 59.2 ± 11.3 vs. 36.4 ± 8.8% (P = 0.005) at 1 μm MK2206 and 64.4 ± 11.5 vs. 38.5 ± 18.9% (P = 0.02) at 3 μm MK2206 for cells with mutations vs. cells without. The SW1736 cell, lacking mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, had minimal response to MK2206, but transfection with exogenous PIK3CA mutants, PIK3CA H1047R and E545K, significantly increased its sensitivity to MK2206. MK2206 also completely overcame the feedback activation of Akt from temsirolimus-induced mammalian target of rapamycin suppression, and the two inhibitors synergistically inhibited thyroid cancer cell growth. Our study demonstrates a genetic selectivity of MK2206 in inhibiting thyroid cancer cells by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, supporting a clinical trial in thyroid cancer.,,The aim of this study was to show preclinical efficacy and clinical development potential of PKI-587, a dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor. In vitro class 1 PI3K enzyme and human tumor cell growth inhibition assays and in vivo five tumor xenograft models were used to show efficacy. In vitro, PKI-587 potently inhibited class I PI3Ks (IC(50) vs. PI3K-α = 0.4 nmol/L), PI3K-α mutants, and mTOR. PKI-587 inhibited growth of 50 diverse human tumor cell lines at IC(50) values of less than 100 nmol/L. PKI-587 suppressed phosphorylation of PI3K/mTOR effectors (e.g., Akt), and induced apoptosis in human tumor cell lines with elevated PI3K/mTOR signaling. MDA-MB-361 [breast; HER2(+), PIK3CA mutant (E545K)] was particularly sensitive to this effect, with cleaved PARP, an apoptosis marker, induced by 30 nmol/L PKI-587 at 4 hours. In vivo, PKI-587 inhibited tumor growth in breast (MDA-MB-361, BT474), colon (HCT116), lung (H1975), and glioma (U87MG) xenograft models. In MDA-MB-361 tumors, PKI-587 (25 mg/kg, single dose i.v.) suppressed Akt phosphorylation [at threonine(T)308 and serine(S)473] for up to 36 hours, with cleaved PARP (cPARP) evident up to 18 hours. PKI-587 at 25 mg/kg (once weekly) shrank large (∼1,000 mm(3)) MDA-MB-361 tumors and suppressed tumor regrowth. Tumor regression correlated with suppression of phosphorylated Akt in the MDA-MB-361 model. PKI-587 also caused regression in other tumor models, and efficacy was enhanced when given in combination with PD0325901 (MEK 1/2 inhibitor), irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor), or HKI-272 (neratinib, HER2 inhibitor). Significant antitumor efficacy and a favorable pharmacokinetic/safety profile justified phase 1 clinical evaluation of PKI-587.,,AKT is frequently deregulated in cancer, making it an attractive anticancer drug target. CCT128930 is a novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor discovered using fragment- and structure-based approaches. It is a potent, advanced lead pyrrolopyrimidine compound exhibiting selectivity for AKT over PKA, achieved by targeting a single amino acid difference. CCT128930 exhibited marked antiproliferative activity and inhibited the phosphorylation of a range of AKT substrates in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro, consistent with AKT inhibition. CCT128930 caused a G(1) arrest in PTEN-null U87MG human glioblastoma cells, consistent with AKT pathway blockade. Pharmacokinetic studies established that potentially active concentrations of CCT128930 could be achieved in human tumor xenografts. Furthermore, CCT128930 also blocked the phosphorylation of several downstream AKT biomarkers in U87MG tumor xenografts, indicating AKT inhibition in vivo. Antitumor activity was observed with CCT128930 in U87MG and HER2-positive, PIK3CA-mutant BT474 human breast cancer xenografts, consistent with its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. A quantitative immunofluorescence assay to measure the phosphorylation and total protein expression of the AKT substrate PRAS40 in hair follicles is presented. Significant decreases in pThr246 PRAS40 occurred in CCT128930-treated mouse whisker follicles in vivo and human hair follicles treated ex vivo, with minimal changes in total PRAS40. In conclusion, CCT128930 is a novel, selective, and potent AKT inhibitor that blocks AKT activity in vitro and in vivo and induces marked antitumor responses. We have also developed a novel biomarker assay for the inhibition of AKT in human hair follicles, which is currently being used in clinical trials.,,We have shown previously that blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cooperates with a pan-selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in EGFR-driven glioma. In this communication, we tested EGFR-driven glioma differing in PTEN status, treating with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and a novel dual inhibitor of PI3Kalpha and mTOR (PI-103). Erlotinib blocked proliferation only in PTEN(wt) cells expressing EGFR. Although erlotinib monotherapy showed little effect in PTEN(mt) glioma, PI-103 greatly augmented the antiproliferative efficacy of erlotinib in this setting. To address the importance of PI3K blockade, we showed in PTEN(mt) glioma that combining PI-103 and erlotinib was superior to either monotherapy or to therapy combining erlotinib with either rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) or PIK-90 (an inhibitor of PI3Kalpha). These experiments show that a dual inhibitor of PI3Kalpha and mTOR augments the activity of EGFR blockade, offering a mechanistic rationale for targeting EGFR, PI3Kalpha, and mTOR in the treatment of EGFR-driven, PTEN-mutant glioma.,,Class 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in cell proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. Here, we investigated biomarker strategies for PI3K pathway inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Molecular profiling for candidate PI3K predictive biomarkers was conducted on a collection of NSCLC tumor samples. Assays included comparative genomic hybridization, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction gene expression, mutation detection for PIK3CA and other oncogenes, PTEN immunohistochemistry, and FISH for PIK3CA copy number. In addition, a panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized for alterations in the PI3K pathway was screened with PI3K and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to assess the preclinical predictive value of candidate biomarkers. PIK3CA amplification was detected in 37% of squamous tumors and 5% of adenocarcinomas, whereas PIK3CA mutations were found in 9% of squamous and 0% of adenocarcinomas. Total loss of PTEN immunostaining was found in 21% of squamous tumors and 4% of adenocarcinomas. Cell lines harboring pathway alterations (receptor tyrosine kinase activation, PI3K mutation or amplification, and PTEN loss) were exquisitely sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor had broader activity across the cell line panel and in tumor xenografts. The combination of GDC-0941 with paclitaxel, erlotinib, or a mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor had greater effects on cell viability than PI3K inhibition alone. Candidate biomarkers for PI3K inhibitors have predictive value in preclinical models and show histology-specific alterations in primary tumors, suggesting that distinct biomarker strategies may be required in squamous compared with nonsquamous NSCLC patient populations.,,The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is commonly dysregulated in human cancer, making it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapeutics. We have used a mouse model of ovarian cancer generated by Kras(G12D) activation and Pten deletion in the ovarian surface epithelium for the preclinical assessment of a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502. To enable higher throughput studies, we developed an orthotopic primary transplant model from these mice and evaluated therapeutic response to PF-04691502 using small-animal ultrasound and FDG-PET imaging. PF-04691502 inhibited tumor growth at 7 days by 72% ± 9. FDG-PET imaging revealed that PF-04691502 reduced glucose metabolism dramatically, suggesting FDG-PET may be exploited as an imaging biomarker of target inhibition by PF-04691502. Tissue biomarkers of PI3K/mTOR pathway activity, p-AKT (S473), and p-RPS6 (S240/244), were also dramatically inhibited following PF-04691502 treatment. However, as a single agent, PF-04691502 did not induce tumor regression and the long-term efficacy was limited, with tumor proliferation continuing in the presence of drug treatment. We hypothesized that tumor progression was because of concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway downstream of Kras(G12D) expression promoting cell survival and that the therapeutic effect of PF-04691502 would be enhanced by combinatory inhibition of MEK using PD-0325901. This combination induced striking tumor regression, apoptosis associated with upregulation of Bim and downregulation of Mcl-1, and greatly improved duration of survival. These data suggest that contemporaneous MEK inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity associated with abrogation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, converting tumor growth inhibition to tumor regression in a mouse model of ovarian cancer driven by PTEN loss and mutant K-Ras.,,The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in human cancers, and mTOR is a clinically validated target. mTOR forms two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which regulate cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Rapamycin and its analogues partially inhibit mTOR through allosteric binding to mTORC1, but not mTORC2, and have shown clinical utility in certain cancers. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of OSI-027, a selective and potent dual inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 with biochemical IC(50) values of 22 nmol/L and 65 nmol/L, respectively. OSI-027 shows more than 100-fold selectivity for mTOR relative to PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and DNA-PK. OSI-027 inhibits phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K1 as well as the mTORC2 substrate AKT in diverse cancer models in vitro and in vivo. OSI-027 and OXA-01 (close analogue of OSI-027) potently inhibit proliferation of several rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive nonengineered and engineered cancer cell lines and also, induce cell death in tumor cell lines with activated PI3K-AKT signaling. OSI-027 shows concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and AKT in tumor tissue with resulting tumor growth inhibition. OSI-027 shows robust antitumor activity in several different human xenograft models representing various histologies. Furthermore, in COLO 205 and GEO colon cancer xenograft models, OSI-027 shows superior efficacy compared with rapamycin. Our results further support the important role of mTOR as a driver of tumor growth and establish OSI-027 as a potent anticancer agent. OSI-027 is currently in phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.,,We describe the preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of GDC-0068, a novel highly selective ATP-competitive pan-Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers.

GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally bioavailable Akt kinase inhibitor that shows pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our preclinical data provide a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate GDC-0068 in cancers with activated Akt signaling.,,Alterations of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway occur broadly in cancer via multiple mechanisms including mutation of the PIK3CA gene, loss or mutation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes.

These preclinical data show that GDC-0980 is a potent and effective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with promise for the clinic.,,The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is frequently activated in endometrial cancer through various PI3K/AKT-activating genetic alterations. We examined the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235--a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor--and RAD001--an mTOR inhibitor--in 13 endometrial cancer cell lines, all of which possess one or more alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and K-Ras. We also combined these compounds with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (PD98059 or UO126) in cell lines with K-Ras alterations (mutations or amplification). PTEN mutant cell lines without K-Ras alterations (n = 9) were more sensitive to both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 than were cell lines with K-Ras alterations (n = 4). Dose-dependent growth suppression was more drastically induced by NVP-BEZ235 than by RAD001 in the sensitive cell lines. G1 arrest was induced by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner. We observed in vivo antitumor activity of both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 in nude mice. The presence of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or UO126, sensitized the K-Ras mutant cells to NVP-BEZ235. Robust growth suppression by NVP-BEZ235 suggests that a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic for endometrial carcinomas. Our data suggest that mutational statuses of PTEN and K-Ras might be useful predictors of sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235 in certain endometrial carcinomas.,,Aberrant activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays an important role in breast cancer progression and represents a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. In this study, we report the impact of the investigational drug MLN0128, a potent and selective small molecule active-site TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor, on tumor growth and metastasis using human breast cancer xenograft models. We assessed in vitro antiproliferative activity of MLN0128 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We next evaluated the impact of MLN0128 on tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis using mammary fat pad xenograft models of a non-VEGF (ML20) and a VEGF-driven (MV165) MCF-7 sublines harboring PIK3CA mutations. MLN0128 potently inhibited cell proliferation in various breast cancer cell lines harboring PIK3CA (IC(50): 1.5-53 nM), PTEN (IC(50): 1-149 nM), KRAS, and/or BRAF mutations (IC(50): 13-162 nM), and in human endothelial cells (IC(50): 33-40 nM) in vitro. In vivo, MLN0128 decreased primary tumor growth significantly in both non-VEGF (ML20; p = 0.05) and VEGF-driven MCF-7 (MV165; p = 0.014) xenograft models. MLN0128 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, S6, 4E-BP1, and NDRG1 in both models. In contrast, rapamycin increased Akt activity and failed to reduce the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, PRAS40, and NDRG1. VEGF-induced lung metastasis in MV165 is inhibited by MLN0128 and rapamycin. In conclusion, MLN0128 inhibits TORC1/2-dependent signaling in preclinical models of breast cancer. MLN0128 appears to be superior in blocking mTORC1/2 signaling in contrast to rapamycin. Our findings support the clinical research of MLN0128 in patients with breast cancer and metastasis.,,We tested the hypothesis that allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206 inhibits tumor growth, and that PTEN/PIK3CA mutations confer MK-2206 sensitivity. MK-2206 effects on cell signaling were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity. Stable transfection of PIK3CA E545K or H1047R mutant plasmids into normal-like MCF10A breast cells enhanced MK-2206 sensitivity. Cell lines that were less sensitive to MK-2206 had lower ratios of Akt1/Akt2 and had less growth inhibition with Akt siRNA knockdown. In PTEN-mutant ZR75-1 breast cancer xenografts, MK-2206 treatment inhibited Akt signaling, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206-sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.;;A 58-year-old woman presented with metastatic endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma after being previously treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for early-stage endometrial cancer. She had received several lines of chemotherapy for multiple relapses over 9 years and displayed a profound sensitivity to platinum-containing regimens. CT scans demonstrated progressing liver, lung and peritoneal metastases and MRI detected multiple intracerebral metastases. New brain metastases secondary to progressive endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. On the basis of her sensitivity to repeated platinum treatment she was treated with the oral poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) 1 inhibitor olaparib as part of a phase I trial. Repeat MRI scan at week 10 of treatment showed a significant reduction in the size of the brain metastases without steroid treatment or radiotherapy and the patient reported subjective improvement in tumor-related symptoms. After 8 months of olaparib treatment the patient developed objective disease progression. The tumor biopsy was negative for somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, but displayed loss of PTEN, which has been suggested to be another predictive marker for sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The patient remained alive for 10 months after completing olaparib, having gone on to derive further clinical benefit from repeat exposure to platinum-based therapy.,,PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) loss of function is the most common genetic aberration in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. In addition to its well-described role in cell signaling, PTEN is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Loss of PTEN function causes defects in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and, therefore, sensitizes cells to inhibition of the poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP). Here, we determined the PTEN status of eight endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines and correlated it with in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor KU0058948. PTEN-deficient cells showed a significantly greater sensitivity to KU0058948 than the two endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines with wild-type PTEN. The cell lines lacking PTEN expression were unable to elicit a homologous recombination damage response as assayed by RAD51 focus function (a marker of competent homologous recombination DNA repair) upon irradiation and treatment with PARP inhibitors. PTEN silencing in PTEN wild-type Hec-1b cells resulted in reduced RAD51 foci formation after DNA damage and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PTEN reexpression in PTEN-null cell lines resulted in enhanced RAD51 foci formation and in relative resistance to KU0058948. Given that up to 80% of endometrioid endometrial cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that PARP inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for a subset of endometrioid endometrial cancers.;;A 58-year-old woman presented with metastatic endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma after being previously treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for early-stage endometrial cancer.

The tumor biopsy was negative for somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, but displayed loss of PTEN, which has been suggested to be another predictive marker for sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The patient remained alive for 10 months after completing olaparib, having gone on to derive further clinical benefit from repeat exposure to platinum-based therapy.,,PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) loss of function is the most common genetic aberration in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. In addition to its well-described role in cell signaling, PTEN is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Loss of PTEN function causes defects in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and, therefore, sensitizes cells to inhibition of the poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP). Here, we determined the PTEN status of eight endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines and correlated it with in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor KU0058948. PTEN-deficient cells showed a significantly greater sensitivity to KU0058948 than the two endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines with wild-type PTEN. The cell lines lacking PTEN expression were unable to elicit a homologous recombination damage response as assayed by RAD51 focus function (a marker of competent homologous recombination DNA repair) upon irradiation and treatment with PARP inhibitors. PTEN silencing in PTEN wild-type Hec-1b cells resulted in reduced RAD51 foci formation after DNA damage and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PTEN reexpression in PTEN-null cell lines resulted in enhanced RAD51 foci formation and in relative resistance to KU0058948. Given that up to 80% of endometrioid endometrial cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that PARP inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for a subset of endometrioid endometrial cancers.;;Prostate cancer is characterized by its dependence on androgen receptor (AR) and frequent activation of PI3K signaling. We find that AR transcriptional output is decreased in human and murine tumors with PTEN deletion and that PI3K pathway inhibition activates AR signaling by relieving feedback inhibition of HER kinases. Similarly, AR inhibition activates AKT signaling by reducing levels of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. Thus, these two oncogenic pathways cross-regulate each other by reciprocal feedback. Inhibition of one activates the other, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival. However, combined pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and AR signaling caused near-complete prostate cancer regressions in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model and in human prostate cancer xenografts, indicating that both pathways coordinately support survival.;;Prostate cancer is characterized by its dependence on androgen receptor (AR) and frequent activation of PI3K signaling.

We have used a mouse model of ovarian cancer generated by Kras(G12D) activation and Pten deletion in the ovarian surface epithelium for the preclinical assessment of a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502. To enable higher throughput studies, we developed an orthotopic primary transplant model from these mice and evaluated therapeutic response to PF-04691502 using small-animal ultrasound and FDG-PET imaging. PF-04691502 inhibited tumor growth at 7 days by 72% ± 9. FDG-PET imaging revealed that PF-04691502 reduced glucose metabolism dramatically, suggesting FDG-PET may be exploited as an imaging biomarker of target inhibition by PF-04691502. Tissue biomarkers of PI3K/mTOR pathway activity, p-AKT (S473), and p-RPS6 (S240/244), were also dramatically inhibited following PF-04691502 treatment. However, as a single agent, PF-04691502 did not induce tumor regression and the long-term efficacy was limited, with tumor proliferation continuing in the presence of drug treatment. We hypothesized that tumor progression was because of concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway downstream of Kras(G12D) expression promoting cell survival and that the therapeutic effect of PF-04691502 would be enhanced by combinatory inhibition of MEK using PD-0325901. This combination induced striking tumor regression, apoptosis associated with upregulation of Bim and downregulation of Mcl-1, and greatly improved duration of survival. These data suggest that contemporaneous MEK inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity associated with abrogation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, converting tumor growth inhibition to tumor regression in a mouse model of ovarian cancer driven by PTEN loss and mutant K-Ras.;;The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is commonly dysregulated in human cancer, making it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapeutics.

Loss of PTEN causes deregulated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/serine-threonine kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling which may provide neoplastic cells with a selective survival advantage by enhancing angiogenesis, protein translation, and cell cycle progression. Temsirolimus, an ester derivative of rapamycin that inhibits mTOR, was evaluated in this setting. Sequential phase II studies evaluated single-agent activity of temsirolimus in women with recurrent or metastatic chemotherapy-naive or chemotherapy-treated endometrial cancer. Temsirolimus 25 mg intravenously was administered weekly in 4-week cycles. In the chemotherapy-naive group, 33 patients received a median of four cycles (range, one to 23 cycles). Of the 29 patients evaluable for response, four (14%) had an independently confirmed partial response and 20 (69%) had stable disease as best response, with a median duration of 5.1 months (range, 3.7 to 18.4 months) and 9.7 months (range, 2.1 to 14.6 months). Only five patients (18%) had progressive disease. In the chemotherapy-treated group, 27 patients received a median of three cycles (range, one to six cycles). Of the 25 patients evaluable for response, one (4%) had an independently confirmed partial response, and 12 patients (48%) had stable disease, with a median duration of 4.3 months (range, 3.6 to 4.9 months) and 3.7 months (range, 2.4 to 23.2 months). PTEN loss (immunohistochemistry and mutational analysis) and molecular markers of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway did not correlate with the clinical outcome. mTOR inhibition with temsirolimus has encouraging single-agent activity in endometrial cancer which is higher in chemotherapy-naive patients than in chemotherapy-treated patients and is independent of PTEN status. The difference in activity according to prior therapy should be factored into future clinical trial designs.,,This study aimed to determine whether the expression of various tumor biomarkers of the mTOR pathway predicts tumor response to everolimus in metastatic recurrent endometrial cancer. Tumor blocks from 44 patients of a phase II clinical trial receiving everolimus until progression or toxicity were collected and evaluated at 3 and 6 months for response. Thirty-six blocks were available for analysis of ER, PR, HER2, LKB1, PI3K, PTEN, pAKT, 4E-BP1, p4E-BP1, and S6RP expression by immunohistochemistry, PTEN deletion by FISH, and mutational status of K-RAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 genes. Twelve of 34 evaluable patients had partial response or stable disease (PR, SD) and 22 had progressive disease (PD). Immunohistochemistry showed that no protein expression could predict response to everolimus. Neither could loss of PTEN expression or PTEN deletion or PTEN mutation predict patient outcome. Thirty-one samples were assessable for K-RAS mutations (ten for PR+SD and 21 for PD). There are only four patients with K-RAS mutations and none of them responded to treatment. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer in patients without K-RAS mutations (PFS 3.12 ± 1.7 months versus 1.05 ± 0.4 months, p < 0.001; OS 9.28 ± 2.0 months versus 2.30 ± 1.4 months, p = 0.034). In conclusion, the level of expression of proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway tested in this study cannot predict response to everolimus.

MK-2206 is a potent, oral allosteric inhibitor of all AKT isoforms with antitumor activity in preclinical models. A phase I study of MK-2206 was conducted to investigate its safety, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and preliminary antitumor efficacy. Patients with advanced solid tumors received MK-2206 on alternate days. Paired tumor biopsies were mandated at the MTD for biomarker studies. PD studies incorporated tumor and hair follicle analyses, and putative predictive biomarker studies included tumor somatic mutation analyses and immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss. Thirty-three patients received MK-2206 at 30, 60, 75, or 90 mg on alternate days. Dose-limiting toxicities included skin rash and stomatitis, establishing the MTD at 60 mg. Drug-related toxicities included skin rash (51.5%), nausea (36.4%), pruritus (24.2%), hyperglycemia (21.2%), and diarrhea (21.2%). PKs (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 48 hours and maximum measured plasma concentration) were dose proportional. Phosphorylated serine 473 AKT declined in all tumor biopsies assessed (P = .015), and phosphorylated threonine 246 proline-rich AKT substrate 40 was suppressed in hair follicles at 6 hours (P = .008), on days 7 (P = .028) and 15 (P = .025) with MK-2206; reversible hyperglycemia and increases in insulin c-peptide were also observed, confirming target modulation. A patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PTEN loss; KRAS G12D mutation) treated at 60 mg on alternate days experienced a decrease of approximately 60% in cancer antigen 19-9 levels and 23% shrinkage in tumor measurements. Two patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors had minor tumor responses. MK-2206 was well tolerated, with evidence of AKT signaling blockade. Rational combination trials are ongoing to maximize clinical benefit with this therapeutic strategy.;;AKT signaling is frequently deregulated in human cancers.

To evaluate everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and to explore potentially predictive serum biomarkers by proteomics, the significance of PTEN status in tumor tissue, and the impact of everolimus on immune cell subpopulations and function. A total of 37 chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC and progressive disease were recruited to this single-arm phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00976755). Everolimus was administered continuously at a dose of 10mg daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 wk defined as the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic progression, or clinical progression. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Fisher exact tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. Time-to-event end points were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression. A total of 13 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval, 20-53) met the primary end point. Confirmed PSA response ≥50% was seen in two (5%), and four further patients (11%) had a PSA decline ≥30%. Higher serum levels of carboxypeptidase M and apolipoprotein B were predictive for reaching the primary end point. Deletion of PTEN was associated with longer PFS and response. Treatment was associated with a dose-dependent decrease of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes and CD8 proliferation and an increase in regulatory T cells. Small sample size was the major limitation of the study. Everolimus activity in unselected patients with mCRPC is moderate, but PTEN deletion could be predictive for response. Several serum glycoproteins were able to predict PFS at 12 wk. Prospective validation of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

There is an additional layer of complexity, in that tumour evolution may be influenced by selective pressure provided by therapy, in a similar fashion to that occurring in infectious diseases. Here we studied tumour genomic evolution in a patient (index patient) with metastatic breast cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha, PI(3)Kα) mutation. The patient was treated with the PI(3)Kα inhibitor BYL719, which achieved a lasting clinical response, but the patient eventually became resistant to this drug (emergence of lung metastases) and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and material from a total of 14 metastatic sites was collected and sequenced. All metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had a copy loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and those lesions that became refractory to BYL719 had additional and different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the loss of PTEN expression. To put these results in context, we examined six other patients also treated with BYL719. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in one of these patients, whereas in two others PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of progression. To characterize our findings functionally, we examined the effects of PTEN knockdown in several preclinical models (both in cell lines intrinsically sensitive to BYL719 and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our index patient), which we found resulted in resistance to BYL719, whereas simultaneous PI(3)K p110β blockade reverted this resistance phenotype. We conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI(3)Kα inhibition. ;;T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments. However, most patients still fail to respond to these therapies. The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. We show that loss of PTEN in tumor cells in preclinical models of melanoma inhibits T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreases T-cell trafficking into tumors. In patients, PTEN loss correlates with decreased T-cell infiltration at tumor sites, reduced likelihood of successful T-cell expansion from resected tumors, and inferior outcomes with PD-1 inhibitor therapy. PTEN loss in tumor cells increased the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in decreased T-cell infiltration in tumors, and inhibited autophagy, which decreased T cell-mediated cell death. Treatment with a selective PI3Kβ inhibitor improved the efficacy of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in murine models. Together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN loss promotes immune resistance and support the rationale to explore combinations of immunotherapies and PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors. This study adds to the growing evidence that oncogenic pathways in tumors can promote resistance to the antitumor immune response. As PTEN loss and PI3K-AKT pathway activation occur in multiple tumor types, the results support the rationale to further evaluate combinatorial strategies targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.;;T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;De  Roock W. et al.,Lancet Oncol.,2011,,Loupakis F. et al.,J.

Mutant GNAQ/11 are not currently therapeutically targetable. Inhibiting key down-stream effectors of GNAQ/11 represents a rational therapeutic approach for uveal melanomas that harbor these mutations. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK) and PI3K/AKT pathways are activated in uveal melanoma. In this study, we test the effect of the clinically relevant small molecule inhibitors GSK1120212 (MEK inhibitor) and GSK2126458 (pan class I PI3K inhibitor) on uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds. We use the largest set of genetically annotated uveal melanoma cell lines to date to carry out in vitro cellular signaling, cell-cycle regulation, growth, and apoptosis analyses. RNA interference and small molecule MEK and/or PI3K inhibitor treatment were used to determine the dependency of uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds on MEK/MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT signaling. Proteomic network analysis was done to unveil signaling alterations in response to MEK and/or PI3K small molecule inhibition. GNAQ/11 mutation status was not a determinant of whether cells would undergo cell-cycle arrest or growth inhibition to MEK and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition. A reverse correlation was observed between MAPK and AKT phosphorylation after MEK or PI3K inhibition, respectively. Neither MEK nor PI3K inhibition alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis in the majority of cell lines; however, the combination of MEK + PI3K inhibitor treatment resulted in the marked induction of apoptosis in a GNAQ/11 mutant-dependent manner. MEK + PI3K inhibition may be an effective combination therapy in uveal melanoma, given the inherent reciprocal activation of these pathways within these cells.,,Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.	;;;;Khalili JS. et al.,Clin.

However, functional consequences of the JAK3 mutations in TMD patients remain undetermined. To further understand how JAK3 mutations are involved in the development and/or progression of leukaemia in Down syndrome, additional TMD patients and the DS-AMKL cell line MGS were screened for JAK3 mutations, and we examined whether each JAK3 mutation is an activating mutation. JAK3 mutations were not detected in 10 TMD samples that had not previously been studied. Together with our previous report we detected JAK3 mutations in one in 11 TMD patients. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time that a TMD patient-derived JAK3 mutation (JAK3(I87T)), as well as two novel JAK3 mutations (JAK3(Q501H) and JAK3(R657Q)) identified in an MGS cell line, were activating mutations. Treatment of MGS cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK3 mutants with JAK3 inhibitors significantly decreased their growth and viability. These results suggest that the JAK3 activating mutation is an early event during leukaemogenesis in Down syndrome, and they provide proof-of-principle evidence that JAK3 inhibitors would have therapeutic effects on TMD and DS-AMKL patients carrying activating JAK3 mutations.

Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity.

We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

A comprehensive analysis of his tumor revealed a previously undescribed, kinase-inactivating BRAF mutation ((Y472C)BRAF); no inactivating BRAF mutations were found in the nonresponding tumors taken from other patients. Cells transfected with (Y472C)BRAF exhibited CRAF, MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation-characteristics identical to signaling changes that occur with previously known kinase-inactivating BRAF mutants. Dasatinib selectively induced senescence in NSCLC cells with inactivating BRAF mutations. Transfection of other NSCLC cells with these BRAF mutations also increased these cells' dasatinib sensitivity, whereas transfection with an activating BRAF mutation led to their increased dasatinib resistance. The sensitivity induced by (Y472C)BRAF was reversed by the introduction of a BRAF mutation that impairs RAF dimerization. Dasatinib inhibited CRAF modestly, but concurrently induced RAF dimerization, resulting in ERK activation in NSCLC cells with kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations. The sensitivity of NSCLC with kinase-impaired BRAF to dasatinib suggested synthetic lethality of BRAF and an unknown dasatinib target. Inhibiting BRAF in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type BRAF likewise enhanced these cells' dasatinib sensitivity. Thus, the patient's BRAF mutation was likely responsible for his tumor's marked response to dasatinib, suggesting that tumors bearing kinase-impaired BRAF mutations may be exquisitely sensitive to dasatinib. Moreover, the potential synthetic lethality of combination therapy including dasatinib and BRAF inhibitors may lead to additional therapeutic options against cancers with wild-type BRAF.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling therefore is an attractive strategy for anticancer drugs. In this study, we have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of the β-catenin signaling pathway, JW55, that functions via inhibition of the PARP domain of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (TNKS1/2), regulators of the β-catenin destruction complex. Inhibition of TNKS1/2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity by JW55 led to stabilization of AXIN2, a member of the β-catenin destruction complex, followed by increased degradation of β-catenin. In a dose-dependent manner, JW55 inhibited canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells that contained mutations in either the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) locus or in an allele of β-catenin. In addition, JW55 reduced XWnt8-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and tamoxifen-induced polyposis formation in conditional APC mutant mice. Together, our findings provide a novel chemotype for targeting canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling through inhibiting the PARP domain of TNKS1/2.,,Most colorectal cancers (CRC) are initiated by mutations of APC, leading to increased β-catenin-mediated signaling. However, continued requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and specific small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/β-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting β-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation-driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufficient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that β-catenin-dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efficacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.

Several new therapies that target this axis have demonstrated clinical activity. In this article, preclinical and clinical findings occurring in the field of AR-targeted therapies are reviewed. Reviews of scientific and clinical development are divided into those occurring prereceptor (androgen production and conversion) and at the level of the receptor (AR aberrations and therapies targeting AR directly). Intracrine androgen production and AR amplification, among others, are among the principal aberrancies driving CRPC growth. Phase III data with abiraterone acetate and phase II data with MDV-3100, along with other similar therapies, confirm for the clinician that the scientific findings related to persistent AR signaling in a castrate milieu can be harnessed to produce significant clinical benefit for patients with the disease. Studies aimed at optimizing the timing of their use and exploring the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are under way. The clinical success of therapies that directly target androgen synthesis as well as the most common aberrancies of the AR confirm that prostate cancer retains dependence on AR signaling, even in the castrate state.;;Enzalutamide is a novel antiandrogen with proven efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To evaluate enzalutamide's effects on cancer and on androgens in blood and bone marrow, and associate these with clinical observations. In this prospective phase 2 study, 60 patients with bone mCRPC received enzalutamide 160mg orally daily and had transilial bone marrow biopsies before treatment and at 8 wk of treatment. Androgen signaling components (androgen receptor [AR], AR splice variant 7 (ARV7), v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog [ERG], cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 [CYP17]) and molecules implicated in mCRPC progression (phospho-Met, phospho-Src, glucocorticoid receptor, Ki67) were assessed by immunohistochemistry; testosterone, cortisol, and androstenedione concentrations were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; AR copy number was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive statistics were applied. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 22 wk (95% confidence interval, 19.9-29.6). Twenty-two (37%) patients exhibited primary resistance to enzalutamide, discontinuing treatment within 4 mo. Maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% occurred in 27 (45%) and 13 (22%) patients, respectively. Following 8 wk of treatment, bone marrow and circulating testosterone levels increased. Pretreatment tumor nuclear AR overexpression (> 75%) and CYP17 (> 10%) expression were associated with benefit (p = 0.018). AR subcellular localization shift from the nucleus was confirmed in eight paired samples (with PSA decline) of 23 evaluable paired samples. Presence of an ARV7 variant was associated with primary resistance to enzalutamide (p = 0.018). Limited patient numbers warrant further validation. The observed subcellular shift of AR from the nucleus and increased testosterone concentration provide the first evidence in humans that enzalutamide suppresses AR signaling while inducing an adaptive feedback. Persistent androgen signaling in mCRPC was predictive of benefit and ARV7 was associated with primary resistance. We report a first bone biopsy study in metastatic prostate cancer in humans that searched for predictors of outcome of enzalutamide therapy. Benefit is linked to a pretreatment androgen-signaling signature. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01091103.;;Androgen receptor (AR) gene aberrations are rare in prostate cancer before primary hormone treatment but emerge with castration resistance. To determine AR gene status using a minimally invasive assay that could have broad clinical utility, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing approach amenable to plasma DNA, covering all AR coding bases and genomic regions that are highly informative in prostate cancer. We sequenced 274 plasma samples from 97 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone at two institutions. We controlled for normal DNA in patients' circulation and detected a sufficiently high tumor DNA fraction to quantify AR copy number state in 217 samples (80 patients). Detection of AR copy number gain and point mutations in plasma were inversely correlated, supported further by the enrichment of nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations in AR copy number normal as opposed to AR gain samples. Whereas AR copy number was unchanged from before treatment to progression and no mutant AR alleles showed signal for acquired gain, we observed emergence of T878A or L702H AR amino acid changes in 13% of tumors at progression on abiraterone. Patients with AR gain or T878A or L702H before abiraterone (45%) were 4.9 and 7.8 times less likely to have a ≥50 or ≥90% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), respectively, and had a significantly worse overall [hazard ratio (HR), 7.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.51 to 15.34; P = 1.3 × 10(-9)) and progression-free (HR, 3.73; 95% CI, 2.17 to 6.41; P = 5.6 × 10(-7)) survival. Evaluation of plasma AR by next-generation sequencing could identify cancers with primary resistance to abiraterone.	;;,,Ryan CJ. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011;;Efstathiou E. et al.,Eur.

The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation.

Sanger sequencing of the tyrosine kinome identified mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene in 3.8% of squamous cell lung cancers and cell lines. Squamous lung cancer cell lines harboring DDR2 mutations were selectively killed by knock-down of DDR2 by RNAi or by treatment with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Tumors established from a DDR2 mutant cell line were sensitive to dasatinib in xenograft models. Expression of mutated DDR2 led to cellular transformation which was blocked by dasatinib. A squamous cell lung cancer patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation. These data suggest that gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 are important oncogenic events and are amenable to therapy with dasatinib. As dasatinib is already approved for use, these findings could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. DDR2 mutations are present in 4% of lung SCCs, and DDR2 mutations are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. These findings provide a rationale for designing clinical trials with the FDA-approved drug dasatinib in patients with lung SCCs.	Hammerman PS. et al.,Cancer Discov,2011

The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML. We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients. We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.).;;Homeobox (HOX) proteins and the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are frequently highly expressed and mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant HOX expression is found in nearly all AMLs that harbor a mutation in the Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene, and FLT3 is concomitantly mutated in approximately 60% of these cases. Little is known about how mutant NPM1 (NPM1mut) cells maintain aberrant gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the histone modifiers MLL1 and DOT1L control HOX and FLT3 expression and differentiation in NPM1mut AML. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing domain screen, we show NPM1mut AML to be exceptionally dependent on the menin binding site in MLL1. Pharmacologic small-molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL1 protein interaction had profound antileukemic activity in human and murine models of NPM1mut AML. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of menin-MLL1 and DOT1L resulted in dramatic suppression of HOX and FLT3 expression, induction of differentiation, and superior activity against NPM1mut leukemia. MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX, MEIS1, and FLT3 expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1mut AML. Combinatorial small-molecule inhibition has synergistic on-target activity and constitutes a novel therapeutic concept for this common AML subtype.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

To aid the clinical development of dasatinib in prostate cancer, we utilized preclinical models to identify potential molecular markers for patient stratification and efficacy monitoring. Using gene expression profiling, we first identified 174 genes whose expression was highly correlated with in vitro sensitivity of 16 cell lines and, thus, considered as candidate efficacy predictive markers. Among these are important prostatic cell lineage markers, cytokeratin 5, androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen. Our results indicate that 'basal type' cell lines with high expression of cytokeratin 5 and low expression of androgen receptor or prostate specific antigen are sensitive to dasatinib. To identify markers as surrogates for biological activity, we treated cell lines with dasatinib and identified genes whose expression was significantly modulated by the drug. Ten genes, including that encoding urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), were found to not only be potential efficacy markers but also to have reduced expression upon dasatinib treatment. The down-regulation of uPA by dasatinib was drug-specific and correlated with the sensitivity of cell lines to dasatinib. Furthermore, EphA2, a target of dasatinib, was found to be a sensitivity biomarker. Using the gene expression profiling approach and preclinical models, we have identified prostatic biomarkers that are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. This study has provided a basis for clinical evaluation of a potential dasatinib efficacy signature in prostate cancer.,,Src family kinases (SFK) are involved in regulating a multitude of biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival, depending on the cellular context. Therefore, although SFKs are currently being investigated as potential targets for treatment strategies in various cancers, the biological responses to inhibition of SFK signaling in any given tumor type are not predictable. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor with potent antiproliferative activity against hematologic malignancies harboring activated BCR-ABL. In this study, we show that dasatinib blocks migration and invasion of human melanoma cells without affecting proliferation and survival. Moreover, dasatinib completely inhibits SFK kinase activity at low nanomolar concentrations in all eight human melanoma cell lines investigated. In addition, two known downstream targets of SFKs, focal adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate (p130(CAS)), are inhibited with similar concentrations and kinetics. Consistent with inhibition of these signaling pathways and invasion, dasatinib down-regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9. We also provide evidence that dasatinib directly inhibits kinase activity of the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed and/or overactive in many solid tumors, including melanoma. Thus, SFKs and downstream signaling are implicated as having key roles in migration and invasion of melanoma cells.,,Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of dasatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src kinase family, EphA2, and focal adhesion kinase for the treatment of ovarian cancer. We examined the effects of dasatinib on proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and kinase activity using a panel of 34 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction were studied using gene expression profiling. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was used to study the interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of dasatinib were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines with up to a 3 log-fold difference in the IC(50) values (IC(50) range: 0.001-11.3 micromol l(-1)). Dasatinib significantly inhibited invasion, and induced cell apoptosis, but less cell-cycle arrest. At a wide range of clinically achievable drug concentrations, additive and synergistic interactions were observed for dasatinib plus carboplatin (mean CI values, range: 0.73-1.11) or paclitaxel (mean CI values, range: 0.76-1.05).

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations.

Once developed, the progression of pancreatic cancer metastasis is virtually unstoppable with current therapies. Here, we report the remarkable clinical outcome of a patient with advanced, gemcitabine-resistant, pancreatic cancer who was later treated with DNA damaging agents, on the basis of the observation of significant activity of this class of drugs against a personalized xenograft generated from the patient's surgically resected tumor. Mitomycin C treatment, selected on the basis of its robust preclinical activity in a personalized xenograft generated from the patient's tumor, resulted in long-lasting (36+ months) tumor response. Global genomic sequencing revealed biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding PalB2 protein in this patient's cancer; the mutation is predicted to disrupt BRCA1 and BRCA2 interactions critical to DNA double-strand break repair. This work suggests that inactivation of the PALB2 gene is a determinant of response to DNA damage in pancreatic cancer and a new target for personalizing cancer treatment. Integrating personalized xenografts with unbiased exomic sequencing led to customized therapy, tailored to the genetic environment of the patient's tumor, and identification of a new biomarker of drug response in a lethal cancer.;;Metastasis and drug resistance are the major causes of mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer.

BMN 673 is active both through inhibiting PARP catalytic activity and by tightly trapping PARP to DNA at sites of single strand breaks. BMN 673 was tested in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 μM and in vivo at a daily dose of 0.33 mg/kg administered orally twice daily (Mon-Fri) and once daily on weekends (solid tumors) for 28 days. The median relative IC50 (rIC50 ) concentration against the PPTP cell lines was 25.8 nM. The median rIC50 for the Ewing cell lines was lower than for the remaining cell lines (6.4 vs. 31.1 nM, respectively). In vivo BMN 673 induced statistically significant differences in EFS distribution in 17/43 (39.5%) xenograft models. Three objective regressions were observed: a complete response (CR) in a medulloblastoma line (BT-45), a maintained CR in a Wilms tumor line (KT-10), and a maintained CR in an ependymoma line (BT-41). BMN 673 maintained its high level of activity against KT-10 with a threefold reduction in dose. KT-10 possesses a truncating mutation in PALB2 analogous to PALB2 mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that abrogate homologous recombination (HR) repair.

We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal rearrangements leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known to be important in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and new candidate drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence. Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA maintenance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA damage repair deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals with these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded. ;;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of malignancies and a major health burden.

We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs.;;Angiomyolipomas are slow-growing tumours associated with constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The insidious growth of these tumours predisposes patients to serious complications including retroperitoneal haemorrhage and impaired renal function. Everolimus, a rapamycin derivative, inhibits the mTOR pathway by acting on the mTOR complex 1. We compared the angiomyolipoma response rate on everolimus with placebo in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphanioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomata. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with at least one angiomyolipoma 3 cm or larger in its longest diameter (defined by radiological assessment) and a definite diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 fashion with the use of an interactive web response system, to receive oral everolimus 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response of at least a 50% reduction in total volume of target angiomyolipomas relative to baseline. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00790400. 118 patients (median age 31·0 years; IQR 18·0–61·0) from 24 centres in 11 countries were randomly assigned to receive everolimus (n=79) or placebo (n=39). At the data cutoff, double-blind treatment was ongoing for 98 patients; two main reasons for discontination were disease progression (nine placebo patients) followed by adverse events (two everolimus patients; four placebo patients). The angiomyolipoma response rate was 42% (33 of 79 [95% CI 31–53%]) for everolimus and 0% (0 of 39 [0–9%]) for placebo (response rate difference 42% [24–58%]; one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p<0·0001). The most common adverse events in the everolimus and placebo groups were stomatitis (48% [38 of 79], 8% [3 of 39], respectively), nasopharyngitis (24% [19 of 79] and 31% [12 of 39]), and acne-like skin lesions (22% [17 of 79] and 5% [2 of 39]). Everolimus reduced angiomyolipoma volume with an acceptable safety profile, suggesting it could be a potential treatment for angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis. Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,Renal angiomyolipomas are a frequent manifestation of tuberous sclerosis and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). These disorders are associated with mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 that lead to overactivation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), suggesting an opportunity for targeted therapy by using mTORC1 inhibitors. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the mTORC1 inhibitor sirolimus for treatment of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with these disorders. In this multicenter phase 2 nonrandomized open label trial, 16 patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM and renal angiomyolipoma(s) were treated with oral sirolimus for up to 2 years. Steady-state blood levels were 3 to 10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was change in size of renal angiomyolipomas measured by MRI and assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Secondary outcomes included safety, neurocognitive function, and pulmonary function. The response rate, by RECIST criteria, was 50%. Summated angiomyolipoma diameters were reduced in all 16 patients and by 30% or more in eight (all from the per protocol group of 10). Forty-one of 48 angiomyolipomas were smaller at the last measurement than at baseline. Most shrinkage occurred during the first year of treatment. There was little change in pulmonary function. Recall memory improved in seven of eight patients with tuberous sclerosis. Adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of sirolimus. This study showed sustained regression of renal angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM receiving 2 years of sirolimus treatment. Possible effects on pulmonary function and neurocognition require further investigation.,,PURPOSE Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) represent a family of mesenchymal neoplasms, mechanistically linked through activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. There is no known effective therapy for PEComa, and the molecular pathophysiology of aberrant mTOR signaling provided us with a scientific rationale to target this pathway therapeutically. On this mechanistic basis, we treated three consecutive patients with metastatic PEComa with an oral mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with advanced PEComa were treated with sirolimus and consented to retrospective collection of data from their medical records and analysis of archival tumor specimens. Tumor response was determined by computed tomography scans obtained at the clinical discretion of the treating physicians. Tumors were assessed for immunohistochemical evidence of mTORC1 activation and genetic evidence of alterations in TSC1 and TSC2. Results Radiographic responses to sirolimus were observed in all patients. PEComas demonstrated loss of TSC2 protein expression and evidence of baseline mTORC1 activation. Homozygous loss of TSC1 was identified in one PEComa. CONCLUSION Inhibition of mTORC1, pathologically activated by loss of the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, is a rational mechanistic target for therapy in PEComas. The clinical activity of sirolimus in PEComa additionally strengthens the pathobiologic similarities linking PEComas to other neoplasms related to the tuberous sclerosis complex.;;Rapalogs are allosteric mTOR inhibitors and approved agents for advanced kidney cancer. Reports of clonal heterogeneity in this disease challenge the concept of targeted monotherapy, yet a small subset of patients derives extended benefit. Our aim was to analyze such outliers and explore the genomic background of extreme rapalog sensitivity in the context of intratumor heterogeneity. We analyzed archived tumor tissue of 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma, who previously achieved durable disease control with rapalogs (median duration, 28 months). DNA was extracted from spatially separate areas of primary tumors and metastases. Custom target capture and ultradeep sequencing was used to identify alterations across 230 target genes. Whole-exome sequence analysis was added to investigate genes beyond this original target list. Five long-term responders contributed 14 specimens to explore clonal heterogeneity. Genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were detected in 11 of 14 specimens, offering plausible explanation for exceptional treatment response through alterations in two genes (TSC1 and MTOR). In two subjects, distinct yet functionally convergent alterations activated the mTOR pathway in spatially separate sites. In 1 patient, concurrent genomic events occurred in two separate pathway components across different tumor regions. Analysis of outlier cases can facilitate identification of potential biomarkers for targeted agents, and we implicate two genes as candidates for further study in this class of drugs. The previously reported phenomenon of clonal convergence can occur within a targetable pathway which might have implications for biomarker development beyond this disease and this class of agents.,,,,;;Rapalogs are allosteric mTOR inhibitors and approved agents for advanced kidney cancer.

Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus.

Therapeutic options are limited in recurrent disease, but because RET is a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor involved in cellular growth and proliferation, treatment with a TK inhibitor might be promising. Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations. We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement. The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined. XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation. There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro. No TK inhibitor was superior for all the cell lines tested, indicating that mutation-specific therapies could be beneficial in treating MTC and PTC.;;Medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma (MTC and PTC) are two types of thyroid cancer that can originate from activating mutations or rearrangements in the RET gene.

No TK inhibitor was superior for all the cell lines tested, indicating that mutation-specific therapies could be beneficial in treating MTC and PTC.;;Persistent RET activation is a frequent event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.	Verbeek HH. et al.,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2011;;Verbeek HH. et al.,J. Clin.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01283516.).,,To extend the results of a phase III trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinomas harboring EML4-ALK fusion. We conducted a co-clinical trial in a mouse model comparing the ALK inhibitor crizotinib to the standard-of-care cytotoxic agents docetaxel or pemetrexed. Concordant with the clinical outcome in humans, crizotinib produced a substantially higher response rate compared with chemotherapy, associated with significantly longer progression-free survival. Overall survival was also prolonged in crizotinib- compared with chemotherapy-treated mice. Pemetrexed produced superior overall survival compared with docetaxel, suggesting that this agent may be the preferred chemotherapy in the ALK population. In addition, in the EML4-ALK-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, HSP90 inhibition can overcome both primary and acquired crizotinib resistance. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition, as well as the second-generation ALK inhibitor TAE684, demonstrated activity in newly developed lung adenocarcinoma models driven by crizotinib-insensitive EML4-ALK L1196M or F1174L. Our findings suggest that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in ALK inhibitor-naïve disease and support further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors and second-generation ALK inhibitors in tumors with primary or acquired crizotinib resistance.;;The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

To determine AR gene status using a minimally invasive assay that could have broad clinical utility, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing approach amenable to plasma DNA, covering all AR coding bases and genomic regions that are highly informative in prostate cancer. We sequenced 274 plasma samples from 97 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone at two institutions. We controlled for normal DNA in patients' circulation and detected a sufficiently high tumor DNA fraction to quantify AR copy number state in 217 samples (80 patients). Detection of AR copy number gain and point mutations in plasma were inversely correlated, supported further by the enrichment of nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations in AR copy number normal as opposed to AR gain samples. Whereas AR copy number was unchanged from before treatment to progression and no mutant AR alleles showed signal for acquired gain, we observed emergence of T878A or L702H AR amino acid changes in 13% of tumors at progression on abiraterone. Patients with AR gain or T878A or L702H before abiraterone (45%) were 4.9 and 7.8 times less likely to have a ≥50 or ≥90% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), respectively, and had a significantly worse overall [hazard ratio (HR), 7.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.51 to 15.34; P = 1.3 × 10(-9)) and progression-free (HR, 3.73; 95% CI, 2.17 to 6.41; P = 5.6 × 10(-7)) survival.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas. These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms. The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear. Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.

By longitudinal integrative whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing and targeted sequencing, we identified the first relapse-specific C481S mutation at the ibrutinib binding site of BTK in MCL cells at progression following a durable response. This mutation enhanced BTK and AKT activation and tissue-specific proliferation of resistant MCL cells driven by CDK4 activation. It was absent, however, in patients with primary resistance or progression following transient response to ibrutinib, suggesting alternative mechanisms of resistance. Through synergistic induction of PIK3IP1 and inhibition of PI3K-AKT activation, prolonged early G1 arrest induced by PD 0332991 (palbociclib) inhibition of CDK4 sensitized resistant lymphoma cells to ibrutinib killing when BTK was unmutated, and to PI3K inhibitors independent of C481S mutation. These data identify a genomic basis for acquired ibrutinib resistance in MCL and suggest a strategy to override both primary and acquired ibrutinib resistance. We have discovered the first relapse-specific BTK mutation in patients with MCL with acquired resistance, but not primary resistance, to ibrutinib, and demonstrated a rationale for targeting the proliferative resistant MCL cells by inhibiting CDK4 and the cell cycle in combination with ibrutinib in the presence of BTK(WT) or a PI3K inhibitor independent of BTK mutation. As drug resistance remains a major challenge and CDK4 and PI3K are dysregulated at a high frequency in human cancers, targeting CDK4 in genome-based combination therapy represents a novel approach to lymphoma and cancer therapy.

Hormonal manipulation leads to response in some patients with EC, but resistance derived from PI3K pathway activation has been documented. Targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may overcome endocrine resistance. We conducted a two-institution phase II trial of everolimus and letrozole in women with recurrent EC. Patients were considered incurable, had measurable disease, and were treated with up to two prior cytotoxic regimens. Everolimus was administered orally at 10 mg daily and letrozole was administered orally at 2.5 mg daily. Each cycle consisted of 4 weeks of therapy. Patients were treated until progression, toxicity, or complete response (CR). The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR), which was defined as CR, partial response, or stable disease (≥ 16 weeks) by RECIST 1.0 criteria. Translational studies were performed to correlate biomarkers with response. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (median age, 62 years; range, 24 to 82 years). Thirty-five patients were evaluable for response. The CBR was 40% (14 of 35 patients); the median number of cycles among responders was 15 (range, seven to 29 cycles). The confirmed objective response rate (RR) was 32% (11 of 35 patients; nine CRs and two partial responses; median, 15 cycles; range, eight to 29 cycles). Twenty percent of patients (seven of 35 patients) were taken off treatment after a prolonged CR and at the discretion of the treating clinician. None of the patients discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity. Serous histology was the best predictor of lack of response. Patients with endometrioid histology and CTNNB1 mutations responded well to everolimus and letrozole. Everolimus plus letrozole results in a high CBR and RR in patients with recurrent EC. Further development of this combination in recurrent endometrioid EC is under way.	Slomovitz BM. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015

We evaluated the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in leukemic cell lines bearing or not c-kit mutations. Our data demonstrate that in the AML Kasumi-1 cell line, bearing the N822K c-kit mutation, dasatinib is a potent suppressor of c-kit and Src kinase activity and inhibits the phosphorylation of their downstream target AKT, possibly through the Src-mediated VEGF/VEGFR receptor type 2 pathway. Dasatinib also effectively blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis through caspase-3 activation in Kasumi-1 cells. These data further encourage the integration of dasatinib in the treatment of CBF AML with c-kit mutations in the context of clinical trials, which are eagerly anticipated.	Mpakou VE. et al.,Leuk.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAF(V600E) promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). These effects were antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of CDKN2C and CDKN1A targets CDK2 and CDK4 in vitro. In contrast to BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   )-expressing melanocytes, melanoma cells have an inherent resistance to suppression of AP-1 activity by BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors.

All GBM xenograft lines evaluated in this study had disruptions in the p16(INK4a)-Cdk4/6-Rb pathway. In vitro evaluation using short-term explant cultures from selected GBM xenograft lines showed that PD0332991 effectively arrested cell cycle in G1-phase and inhibited cell proliferation dose-dependently in lines deleted for CDKN2A/B-p16(INK4a) and either single-copy deletion of CDK4 (GBM22), high-level CDK6 amplification (GBM34), or deletion of CDKN2C/p18(INK4c) (GBM43).

Additional xenograft lines were screened, and GBM63 was identified to have p16(INK4a) expression and CDK4 amplification. Similar to the results with GBM5, GBM63 was resistant to PD0332991 treatment. In an orthotopic survival model, treatment of GBM6 xenografts (CDKN2A/B-deleted and CDK4 wild-type) with PD0332991 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation and prolonged survival.

We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.;;,,We sought to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer harboring NRAS mutations. We used preclinical models to identify targeted therapies likely to be of benefit against NRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. We reviewed clinical data from patients whose lung cancers were identified at six institutions or reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) to harbor NRAS mutations. Six NRAS-mutant cell lines were screened for sensitivity against inhibitors of multiple kinases (i.e., EGFR, ALK, MET, IGF-1R, BRAF, PI3K, and MEK). Among 4,562 patients with lung cancers tested, NRAS mutations were present in 30 (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.94%); 28 of these had no other driver mutations. 83% had adenocarcinoma histology with no significant differences in gender. While 95% of patients were former or current smokers, smoking-related G:C>T:A transversions were significantly less frequent in NRAS-mutated lung tumors than KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC; NRAS: 13% (4/30), KRAS: 66% (1772/2733), P < 0.00000001]. Five of 6 NRAS-mutant cell lines were sensitive to the MEK inhibitors, selumetinib and trametinib, but not to other inhibitors tested. NRAS mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Although NRAS mutations are more common in current/former smokers, the types of mutations are not those classically associated with smoking.,,Deregulation of the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK signaling cascade is often caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins which influence the activity of this pathway and include NRAS, KRAS2, FLT3, PTPN11, and BRAF. We report the first comprehensive mutational screen of key exons of these genes in a large cohort of unselected acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases at diagnosis (n = 86) and in a more selected cohort at disease recurrence (n = 47) using the sensitive method of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. We show that somatic mutations that deregulate the pathway constitute one of the most common genetic aberrations in childhood ALL (cALL), being found in 35% of diagnostic and 25% of relapse samples. In matched presentation/relapse pairs, mutations predominating at relapse could be shown to be present at very low levels at diagnosis using allele-specific PCR, thus implicating the mutated clone in disease progression. Importantly, in primary samples, we show that mutations are associated with activated ERK and differential cytotoxicity to MEK-ERK inhibitors was shown for some patients. Inhibitors of the pathway, which are currently undergoing clinical trial, may be a novel therapeutic option for cALL, particularly at relapse.;;So-called RAS-dependent pathways, such as those signalling via mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, are implicated in proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells. However, the effects of their combined blockade and its potential therapeutic utility for the treatment of RAS-mutated MM have not systematically been analysed. Here, we tested the functional consequences of single versus combined inhibition of the MEK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in a large series of primary MM samples (n = 55) and MM cell lines (n = 11). Additionally, the anti-myeloma activity of different treatments was analysed with respect to the RAS mutation status. PI3K/Akt blockade was generally more pro-apoptotic than blockade of MEK/MAPK both in cell lines and in primary MM samples. Simultaneous blockade of both pathways led to significantly enhanced anti-myeloma activity in 75% of primary MM samples, whereas the remainder was largely resistant. Resistance to combination blockade was exclusively observed in RAS wildtype cases, whereas sensitivity was noted in RAS wildtype and in RAS mutated MM. These results suggest that oncogenic RAS is a predictor of sensitivity to combination treatment with PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK inhibitors and that such an approach might therefore be beneficial for this genetically well-defined subgroup of MM patients.;;N-RAS is one member of a family of oncoproteins that are commonly mutated in cancer. Activating mutations in NRAS occur in a subset of colorectal cancers, but little is known about how the mutant protein contributes to the onset and progression of the disease. Using genetically engineered mice, we find that mutant N-RAS strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation. The protumorigenic nature of mutant N-RAS is related to its antiapoptotic function, which is mediated by activation of a noncanonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that signals through STAT3. As a result, inhibition of MAP-ERK kinase selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-RAS. The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for patients with colorectal cancer. These data show for the first time the important role that N-RAS plays in colorectal cancer.,,Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies. We assessed the effects of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from RAS/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic CRCs (mCRC). Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%). Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%). The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%). Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original tumor and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment. The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients. However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses.;;;;The HSP90 inhibitor XL888 is effective at reversing BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma, including that mediated through acquired NRAS mutations. The present study has investigated the mechanism of action of XL888 in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Treatment of NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines with XL888 led to an inhibition of growth, G2-M phase cell-cycle arrest, and the inhibition of cell survival in three-dimensional spheroid and colony formation assays. In vitro, HSP90 inhibition led to the degradation of ARAF, CRAF, Wee1, Chk1, and cdc2 and was associated with decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AKT, mTOR, and c-jun NH2 kinase (JNK) signaling. Apoptosis induction was associated with increased BIM expression and a decrease in the expression of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1. The critical role of increased BIM and decreased Mcl-1 expression in the survival of NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines was shown through siRNA knockdown and overexpression studies. In an animal xenograft model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, XL888 treatment led to reduced tumor growth and apoptosis induction. Important differences in the pattern of client degradation were noted between the in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo, XL888 treatment led to degradation of CDK4 and Wee1 and the inhibition of AKT/S6 signaling with little or no effect observed upon ARAF, CRAF, or MAPK. Blockade of Wee1, using either siRNA knockdown or the inhibitor MK1775, was associated with significant levels of growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. Together, these studies have identified Wee1 as a key target of XL888, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies for NRAS-mutant melanoma.;;PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy. METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 (BRIM-2), patients received oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice per day). Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, cell-cycle progression, and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing, or somatic mutation profiling. Results Vemurafenib inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression. An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies (n = 22; P = .013). Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response. Baseline mutations in MEK1(P124) coexisting with BRAF(V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary NRAS(Q61) mutations or MEK1(Q56P) or MEK1(E203K) mutations. These two activating MEK1 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors. CONCLUSION Vemurafenib inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic BRAF signaling through the MAPK pathway. Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS and MEK1 in subsets of patients. The data suggest that inhibition downstream of BRAF should help to overcome acquired resistance.,,Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a \"long tail\" of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies. ;;Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that harbors KRAS mutations in exon 2 do not benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. Other activating RAS mutations may also be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy. In this prospective-retrospective analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) as compared with FOLFOX4 alone, according to RAS (KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation status. A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following: KRAS exon 3 or 4; NRAS exon 2, 3, or 4; or BRAF exon 15. The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90%. Among 512 patients without RAS mutations, progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.90; P=0.004). Overall survival was 26.0 months in the panitumumab-FOLFOX4 group versus 20.2 months in the FOLFOX4-alone group (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.99; P=0.04). A total of 108 patients (17%) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations. These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment, which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2. BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor. No new safety signals were identified. Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4. In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations, improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy. (Funded by Amgen and others; PRIME ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00364013.).,,Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population. Belgian Federation against Cancer (Stichting tegen Kanker).,,To investigate whether EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway mutations predicted response to monotherapy with panitumumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in a randomized phase III study of metastatic colorectal cancer. Using massively parallel multigene sequencing, we analyzed 320 samples for 9 genes, with multigene sequence data from 288 (90%) samples. Mutation rates were: KRAS (45%), NRAS (5%), BRAF (7%), PIK3CA (9%), PTEN (6%), TP53 (60%), EGFR (1%), AKT1 (<1%), and CTNNB1 (2%). In the randomized study and open-label extension, 22 of 138 (16%) wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients versus 0 of 103 mutant KRAS (codons 12/13) patients had objective responses. Of 6 mutant KRAS (codon 61) patients, 1 with a Q61H mutation achieved partial response during the extension. Among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients, 0 of 9 patients with NRAS mutations, 0 of 13 with BRAF mutations, 2 of 10 with PIK3CA mutations, 1 of 9 with PTEN mutations, and 1 of 2 with CTNNB1 mutations responded to panitumumab. No patients responded to best supportive care alone. Panitumumab treatment was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients [HR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.56]. Among wild-type KRAS patients, a treatment effect for PFS favoring panitumumab occurred in patients with wild-type NRAS (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.56) and wild-type BRAF (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.24-0.55) but not mutant NRAS (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.44-8.44). These results show the feasibility and potential clinical use of next-generation sequencing for evaluating predictive biomarkers.;;There is an unmet need for treatment options in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. Refametinib, an oral, allosteric MEK inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. A phase II study evaluated efficacy and safety of refametinib plus sorafenib in Asian patients with HCC (NCT01204177). Eligible patients received twice-daily refametinib 50 mg plus twice-daily sorafenib 200 mg (morning)/400 mg (evening), with dose escalation to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily from cycle 2 if no grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, or gastrointestinal toxicity occurred. Primary efficacy endpoint: disease control rate. Secondary endpoints: time to progression, overall survival, pharmacokinetic assessment, biomarker analysis, safety, and tolerability. Of 95 enrolled patients, 70 received study treatment. Most patients had liver cirrhosis (82.9%) and hepatitis B viral infection (75.7%). Disease control rate was 44.8% (primary efficacy analysis; n = 58). Median time to progression was 122 days, median overall survival was 290 days (n = 70). Best clinical responders had RAS mutations; majority of poor responders had wild-type RAS. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, vomiting, and nausea. Dose modifications due to adverse events were necessary in almost all patients. Refametinib plus sorafenib showed antitumor activity in patients with HCC and was tolerated at reduced doses by most patients. Frequent dose modifications due to grade 3 adverse events may have contributed to limited treatment effect. Patients with RAS mutations appear to benefit from refametinib/sorafenib combination.;;Biochemical and genetic characterization of D-type cyclins, their cyclin D-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), and the polypeptide CDK4/6 inhibitor p16(INK4)over two decades ago revealed how mammalian cells regulate entry into the DNA synthetic (S) phase of the cell-division cycle in a retinoblastoma protein-dependent manner. These investigations provided proof-of-principle that CDK4/6 inhibitors, particularly when combined with coinhibition of allied mitogen-dependent signal transduction pathways, might prove valuable in cancer therapy. FDA approval of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib used with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for breast cancer treatment highlights long-sought success. The newest findings herald clinical trials targeting other cancers. Rapidly emerging data with selective inhibitors of CDK4/6 have validated these cell-cycle kinases as anticancer drug targets, corroborating longstanding preclinical predictions. This review addresses the discovery of these CDKs and their regulators, as well as translation of CDK4/6 biology to positive clinical outcomes and development of rational combinatorial therapies.,,,,,,,,;;;;,,;;"	Poulikakos PI. et al.,Nature,2010;;,,Ohashi K. et al.,Clin.

Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors. (Funded by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, and others.).;;Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are highly responsive to treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01283516.).,,To extend the results of a phase III trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinomas harboring EML4-ALK fusion. We conducted a co-clinical trial in a mouse model comparing the ALK inhibitor crizotinib to the standard-of-care cytotoxic agents docetaxel or pemetrexed. Concordant with the clinical outcome in humans, crizotinib produced a substantially higher response rate compared with chemotherapy, associated with significantly longer progression-free survival. Overall survival was also prolonged in crizotinib- compared with chemotherapy-treated mice. Pemetrexed produced superior overall survival compared with docetaxel, suggesting that this agent may be the preferred chemotherapy in the ALK population. In addition, in the EML4-ALK-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, HSP90 inhibition can overcome both primary and acquired crizotinib resistance. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition, as well as the second-generation ALK inhibitor TAE684, demonstrated activity in newly developed lung adenocarcinoma models driven by crizotinib-insensitive EML4-ALK L1196M or F1174L. Our findings suggest that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in ALK inhibitor-naïve disease and support further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors and second-generation ALK inhibitors in tumors with primary or acquired crizotinib resistance.	;;Choi YL. et al.,N.

Several alterations leading to EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) resistance to TKI therapy have been described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Only two mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain responsible for crizotinib resistance have been described in patients thus far. A patient suffering from a metastatic NSCLC harboring an ezrin (EZR)-ROS1 fusion gene developed acquired resistance to the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. Molecular analysis (whole-exome sequencing, CGH) and functional studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. Based on this case, we took advantage of the structural homology of ROS1 and ALK to build a predictive model for drug sensitivity regarding future ROS1 mutations. Sequencing revealed a dual mutation, S1986Y and S1986F, in the ROS1 kinase domain. Functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ROS1 harboring either the S1986Y or the S1986F mutation, while conferring resistance to crizotinib and ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib (PF-06463922). The patient's clinical response confirmed the potency of lorlatinib against S1986Y/F mutations. The ROS1 S1986Y/F and ALK C1156Y mutations are homologous and displayed similar sensitivity patterns to ALK/ROS1 TKIs. We extended this analogy to build a model predicting TKI efficacy against potential ROS1 mutations. Clinical evidence, in vitro validation, and homology-based prediction provide guidance for treatment decision making for patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who progressed on crizotinib.

Clin Cancer Res; 22(24); 5983-91. ©2016 AACR.;;The identification of molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a key step to improve therapeutic results for patients with oncogene addiction. Several alterations leading to EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) resistance to TKI therapy have been described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Only two mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain responsible for crizotinib resistance have been described in patients thus far. A patient suffering from a metastatic NSCLC harboring an ezrin (EZR)-ROS1 fusion gene developed acquired resistance to the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. Molecular analysis (whole-exome sequencing, CGH) and functional studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. Based on this case, we took advantage of the structural homology of ROS1 and ALK to build a predictive model for drug sensitivity regarding future ROS1 mutations. Sequencing revealed a dual mutation, S1986Y and S1986F, in the ROS1 kinase domain. Functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ROS1 harboring either the S1986Y or the S1986F mutation, while conferring resistance to crizotinib and ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib (PF-06463922). The patient's clinical response confirmed the potency of lorlatinib against S1986Y/F mutations. The ROS1 S1986Y/F and ALK C1156Y mutations are homologous and displayed similar sensitivity patterns to ALK/ROS1 TKIs. We extended this analogy to build a model predicting TKI efficacy against potential ROS1 mutations. Clinical evidence, in vitro validation, and homology-based prediction provide guidance for treatment decision making for patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who progressed on crizotinib.

In this study, we investigated whether the therapeutic effect of bortezomib is associated with FGFR3 expression. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed in minimal FGFR3 expressing U266 cells and compared to U266 cells overexpressing FGFR3 wild-type (T-U266), or Y373C (Y-U266) or K650E (K-U266) mutant FGFR3. Our results suggested cell survival decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, expression of FGFR3 protein was similarly dose dependent on bortezomib. It is confirmed the bortezomib-induced apoptotic death is correlated with FGFR3 expression. Furthermore, increased expression of p-STAT3, Mcl-1 and VEGF suggested that bortezomib resistance associated with Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be partly mediated through p-STAT3 signaling. Our data indicates that Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be associated with bortezomib-related treatment resistance in multiple myeloma.,,The ectopically expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and its constitutively active mutations have been detected in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). This study investigated whether the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib on malignant plasma cells are associated with FGFR3 expression and the existence of mutations of FGFR3. Cell apoptosis assays were performed in a plasmacytoma cell line, FR4 cells and a myeloma cell line, RPMI8226 cells overexpressing wild-type FGFR3 (FGFR3(WT)) or two different mutants, FGFR3(K650E) or FGFR3(Y373C), and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein was compared between each type of cell. FR4 cells with FGFR3(K650E) showed enhanced sensitivity to bortezomib together with increased induction of ER stress proteins, compared to FR4 cells with mock, FGFR3(WT) or FGFR3(Y373C). RPMI8226 cells with FGFR3(K650E) also showed enhanced bortezomib sensitivity. This study indicated that FGFR3K650E is associated with bortezomib sensitivity in malignant plasma cells via ER stress pathways.

In this report, we describe a unique subset of EOC with alterations in another DNA repair pathway, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which may exhibit a discordance in sensitivities to these drugs. Specifically, 8% of high-grade serous EOC from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset exhibited NER alterations, including nonsynonymous or splice site mutations and homozygous deletions of NER genes. Tumors with NER alterations were associated with improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), compared with patients without NER alterations or BRCA1/2 mutations. Furthermore, patients with tumors with NER alterations had similar OS and PFS as BRCA1/2-mutated patients, suggesting that NER pathway inactivation in EOC conferred enhanced platinum sensitivity, similar to BRCA1/2-mutated tumors. Moreover, two NER mutations (ERCC6-Q524* and ERCC4-A583T), identified in the two most platinum-sensitive tumors, were functionally associated with platinum sensitivity in vitro. Importantly, neither NER alteration affected HR or conferred sensitivity to PARPi or other double-strand break-inducing agents. Overall, our findings reveal a new mechanism of platinum sensitivity in EOC that, unlike defective HR, may lead to a discordance in sensitivity to platinum and PARPi, with potential implications for previously reported and ongoing PARPi trials in this disease.

The FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 displayed encouraging efficacy in patients with FGFR2 fusion-positive ICC in a phase II trial, but the durability of response was limited in some patients. Here, we report the molecular basis for acquired resistance to BGJ398 in three patients via integrative genomic characterization of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA), primary tumors, and metastases. Serial analysis of cfDNA demonstrated multiple recurrent point mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain at progression. Accordingly, biopsy of post-progression lesions and rapid autopsy revealed marked inter- and intralesional heterogeneity, with different FGFR2 mutations in individual resistant clones. Molecular modeling and in vitro studies indicated that each mutation led to BGJ398 resistance and was surmountable by structurally distinct FGFR inhibitors. Thus, polyclonal secondary FGFR2 mutations represent an important clinical resistance mechanism that may guide the development of future therapeutic strategies.Significance: We report the first genetic mechanisms of clinical acquired resistance to FGFR inhibition in patients with FGFR2 fusion-positive ICC. Our findings can inform future strategies for detecting resistance mechanisms and inducing more durable remissions in ICC and in the wide variety of cancers where the FGFR pathway is being explored as a therapeutic target.

Patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with available baseline tumor samples who received vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy were included in analysis. Patient characteristics, VHL gene status and clinical outcome were documented. Our primary end point was to test for response rate in relation to VHL inactivation. Progression-free survival and overall survival in relation to VHL status were investigated as secondary end points. A total of 123 patients were evaluable. Response rate, median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 37% (95% CI 28-46), 10.8 (95% CI 7.7-14.8) and 29.8 (CI not estimable) months, respectively. Patients with VHL inactivation had a response rate of 41% vs 31% for those with wild-type VHL (p = 0.34). Patients with loss of function mutations (frameshift, nonsense, splice and in-frame deletions/insertions) had a 52% response rate vs 31% with wild-type VHL (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis the presence of a loss of function mutation remained an independent prognostic factor associated with improved response. Progression-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different based on VHL status. To our knowledge this is the largest analysis investigating the impact of VHL inactivation on the outcome of vascular endothelial growth factor targeted agents in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We did not find a statistically significant increase in response to vascular endothelial growth factor targeted agents in patients with VHL inactivation. Loss of function mutations identified a population of patients with a greater response. Investigation of downstream markers is under way.	Choueiri TK. et al.,J. Urol.,2008

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity. These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of EZH2.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response.

Lapatinib, a dual HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promising in vitro results in treating HER2(+) cancer cells. However, several studies have shown that activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate resistance to HER-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated whether activated MET can confer resistance to lapatinib inhibition of gastric cancer cells. A panel of gastric cancer cell lines was treated with lapatinib, and we observed that cell proliferation was reduced by 70% and that the degree of HER2 amplification corresponds to sensitivity to lapatinib. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, MET, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited by lapatinib and presumably led to cell-cycle arrest as observed with flow cytometry. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activation of MET receptors rescued cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition by restimulating the downstream pathways and restoring normal cell-cycle progression. This rescue effect could be abrogated by inhibiting MET with PHA-665752 (a highly specific MET inhibitor) or downregulating MET expression with short interfering RNA. No synergy in growth inhibition was observed when cells were treated with a combination of lapatinib and PHA-665752. Repeat studies using insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 3 could not uniformly rescue the lapatinib-treated gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, HGF/MET-mediated resistance to lapatinib is a novel mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted agents in gastric cancer cells. Development of inhibitors targeting multiple receptors or common downstream signaling proteins merits further investigation.;;To investigate whether copy number gain of MET or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) affect trastuzumab sensitivity in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We analysed 130 HER2-positive MBC treated with trastuzumab-based therapy. MET and HGF gene copy numbers (GCN) were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in primary breast cancer samples. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to find the best cutoff point for both MET and HGF GCN. MET FISH-positive cases (N=36, mean 3.72) had a significantly higher trastuzumab failure rate (44.4% vs 16.0%; P=0.001) and a significantly shorter time to progression (5.7 vs 9.9 months; HR 1.74; P=0.006) than MET FISH-negative cases (N=94, mean <3.72). Hepatocyte growth factor GCN was evaluated in 84 cases (64.6%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 33 HGF FISH-positive patients (mean HGF GCN 3.01). HGF FISH-positive status was significantly associated with higher risk of failure (30.3% vs 7.8%; P=0.007) as compared with HGF FISH-negative cases (N=51, mean <3.01). MET and HGF FISH-positive status was highly correlated (P<0.001) and combination of both biomarkers did not increase predictive value of either considered separately.

We identified KRAS mutation as a novel cause of acquired resistance in a patient after a 2-year response to a MET inhibitor. We also observed that 40% to 50% of patients with MET-amplified EGC harbor coamplification of HER2 and/or EGFR concurrently in the same tumor cells, which can drive de novo resistance. One patient with concurrent MET and HER2 amplification was refractory to HER2 blockade, but responded to combined MET/HER2 inhibition. We also found striking heterogeneity in MET amplification between distinct metastatic lesions and primary tumors in individual patients with EGC. In these patients, MET inhibition led to mixed responses and disease progression through outgrowth of non-MET-amplified clones, which could be monitored in circulating tumor DNA. Thus, receptor coamplification and molecular heterogeneity may be key drivers of clinical resistance in MET-amplified EGC. Coamplification of driver oncogenes occurs frequently in EGC and can drive therapeutic resistance, supporting a role for comprehensive molecular analysis prior to targeted therapy. EGCs can also exhibit extensive heterogeneity in gene amplification between distinct tumor lesions within the same patient, suggesting that molecular profiling of a single-lesion biopsy may be insufficient to guide targeted therapy selection.;;MET inhibition is effective in some patients with MET-amplified esophagogastric cancer (EGC), but understanding acquired and de novo resistance mechanisms will be critical to improving therapy.

Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists. ,,Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.

The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.	Schittenhelm MM. et al.,Cancer Res.,2006

These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.	Smalley KS. et al.,Oncogene,2009

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

We show that JQ1 potently reduces the viability of B-ALL cell lines with high-risk cytogenetics. Among the most sensitive were lines with rearrangements of CRLF2, which is overexpressed in ~ 10% of B-ALL. CRLF2 heterodimerizes with the IL7 receptor (IL7R) and signals through JAK2, JAK1, and STAT5 to drive proliferation and suppress apoptosis. As previously observed, JQ1 induced the down-regulation of MYC transcription, the loss of BRD4 at the MYC promoter, and the reduced expression of c-Myc target genes. Strikingly, JQ1 also down-regulated IL7R transcription, depleted BRD4 from the IL7R promoter, and reduced JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated a restricted effect of JQ1 on transcription, with MYC and IL7R being among the most down-regulated genes. Indeed, IL7R was the only cytokine receptor in CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL cells significantly down-regulated by JQ1 treatment. In mice xenografted with primary human CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL, JQ1 suppressed c-Myc expression and STAT5 phosphorylation and significantly prolonged survival. Thus, bromodomain inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for B-ALL as well as other conditions dependent on IL7R signaling.;;CRLF2 rearrangements, JAK1/2 point mutations, and JAK2 fusion genes have been identified in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a recently described subtype of pediatric high-risk B-precursor ALL (B-ALL) which exhibits a gene expression profile similar to Ph-positive ALL and has a poor prognosis. Hyperactive JAK/STAT and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is common in this high-risk subset. We, therefore, investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in xenograft models of 8 pediatric B-ALL cases with and without CRLF2 and JAK genomic lesions. Ruxolitinib treatment yielded significantly lower peripheral blast counts compared with vehicle (P < .05) in 6 of 8 human leukemia xenografts and lower splenic blast counts (P < .05) in 8 of 8 samples. Enhanced responses to ruxolitinib were observed in samples harboring JAK-activating lesions and higher levels of STAT5 phosphorylation. Rapamycin controlled leukemia burden in all 8 B-ALL samples. Survival analysis of 2 representative B-ALL xenografts demonstrated prolonged survival with rapamycin treatment compared with vehicle (P < .01). These data demonstrate preclinical in vivo efficacy of ruxolitinib and rapamycin in this high-risk B-ALL subtype, for which novel treatments are urgently needed, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeted kinase inhibition in Ph-like ALL.

Four major molecular subgroups of MB have been identified, one of which is characterized by activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Preclinical data suggest that inhibitors of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway could become valuable treatment options for patients with this subgroup of MB. Indeed, agents targeting the positive regulator of the pathway, smoothened (SMO), have demonstrated efficacy in a subset of patients with SHH MB. However, because of resistance and the presence of mutations downstream of SMO, not all patients with SHH MB respond to SMO inhibitors. The development of agents that target these resistance mechanisms and the potential for their combination with traditional chemotherapy and SHH inhibitors will be discussed. Due to its extensive molecular heterogeneity, the future of MB treatment is in personalized therapy, which may lead to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. This will include the development of clinically available tests that can efficiently discern the SHH subgroup. The preliminary use of these tests in clinical trials is also discussed herein.

It inhibits angiogenic pathways by mainly targeting the receptors of VEGF and PDGF. In ccRCC, angiogenesis is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) which in turn leads to the induction of HIF1α target genes such as CA9 and VEGF. Furthermore, the angiogenic phenotype of ccRCC is also reflected by endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) or other tumor-promoting factors like Ki67 or survivin. Tissue microarrays from primary tumor specimens of 42 patients with metastatic ccRCC under sunitinib therapy were immunohistochemically stained for selected markers related to angiogenesis. The prognostic and predictive potential of theses markers was assessed on the basis of the objective response rate which was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria after 3, 6, 9 months and after last report (12-54 months) of sunitinib treatment. Additionally, VHL copy number and mutation analyses were performed on DNA from cryo-preserved tumor tissues of 20 ccRCC patients. Immunostaining of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β was significantly associated with the sunitinib response after 6 and 9 months as well as last report under therapy.

In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses high CA9 membrane staining and a response after 9 months were independent prognostic factors for longer OS. Frequently observed copy number loss and mutation of VHL gene lead to altered expression of VHL, HIF-1α, CA9, and VEGF. Immunoexpression of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β in the primary tumors of metastatic ccRCC patients might support the prediction of a good response to sunitinib treatment.

Both the MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth. Tumor samples from 3 of 91 patients with lung cancer (3.3%) without known oncogenic alterations assayed by next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions. ;;Entrectinib is a first-in-class pan-TRK kinase inhibitor currently undergoing clinical testing in colorectal cancer and other tumor types. A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring an LMNA-NTRK1 rearrangement displayed a remarkable response to treatment with entrectinib, which was followed by the emergence of resistance. To characterize the molecular bases of the patient's relapse, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was collected longitudinally during treatment, and a tissue biopsy, obtained before entrectinib treatment, was transplanted in mice (xenopatient), which then received the same entrectinib regimen until resistance developed. Genetic profiling of ctDNA and xenopatient samples showed acquisition of two point mutations in the catalytic domain of NTRK1, p.G595R and p.G667C. Biochemical and pharmacologic analysis in multiple preclinical models confirmed that either mutation renders the TRKA kinase insensitive to entrectinib. These findings can be immediately exploited to design next-generation TRKA inhibitors. We provide proof of principle that analyses of xenopatients (avatar) and liquid biopsies allow the identification of drug resistance mechanisms in parallel with clinical treatment of an individual patient. We describe for the first time that p.G595R and p.G667C TRKA mutations drive acquired resistance to entrectinib in colorectal cancers carrying NTRK1 rearrangements.;;Entrectinib, a potent oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK, was evaluated in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we summarize the overall safety and report the antitumor activity of entrectinib in a cohort of patients with tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions, naïve to prior TKI treatment targeting the specific gene, and who were treated at doses that achieved therapeutic exposures consistent with the recommended phase II dose. Entrectinib was well tolerated, with predominantly Grades 1/2 adverse events that were reversible with dose modification. Responses were observed in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. Notably, a complete CNS response was achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer.Significance: Gene fusions of NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, and ALK (encoding TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK, respectively) lead to constitutive activation of oncogenic pathways. Entrectinib was shown to be well tolerated and active against those gene fusions in solid tumors, including in patients with primary or secondary CNS disease.

However, chemoresistance is a major obstacle. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be one of the causes of chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recently, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been reported to promote CSC-like traits. In this study, we found that a mitotic inhibitor, eribulin mesylate (eribulin), effectively inhibited growth of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Eribulin-sensitive cells showed a higher efficiency for sphere formation, suggesting that these cells possess an enhanced CSC-like phenotype. Moreover, these cells expressed a higher level of hTERT, and suppression of hTERT expression by siRNA resulted in decreased sensitivity to eribulin, suggesting that hTERT may be a target for eribulin. Indeed, we found that eribulin directly inhibited RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity, but not telomerase activity of hTERT in vitro. We propose that eribulin targets the RdRP activity of hTERT and may be an effective therapeutic option for CSCs. Furthermore, hTERT may be a useful biomarker to predict clinical responses to eribulin. ,,,,	Yamaguchi S. et al.,PLoS ONE,2014,,,,

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.

Here, we identify two patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose tumors harbor point mutations in the ALK kinase. The mutations reside in the extracellular domain of ALK and are potently transforming in cytokine-independent cellular assays and primary mouse bone marrow colony formation studies. Strikingly, both mutations conferred sensitivity to ALK kinase inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug crizotinib. On the basis of our results, we propose that tumors harboring ALK mutations may be therapeutically tractable for personalized treatment of certain aggressive leukemias with ALK inhibitors.

We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.	;;Choudhury NJ. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016

METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 (BRIM-2), patients received oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice per day). Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, cell-cycle progression, and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing, or somatic mutation profiling. Results Vemurafenib inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression. An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies (n = 22; P = .013). Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response. Baseline mutations in MEK1(P124) coexisting with BRAF(V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary NRAS(Q61) mutations or MEK1(Q56P) or MEK1(E203K) mutations. These two activating MEK1 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors. CONCLUSION Vemurafenib inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic BRAF signaling through the MAPK pathway. Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS and MEK1 in subsets of patients. The data suggest that inhibition downstream of BRAF should help to overcome acquired resistance.	Trunzer K. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.;;Genetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer.

We conducted a phase II trial in patients with melanoma whose tumors harbored a BRAF mutation. Patients were stratified by phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low) and treated with selumetinib 75 mg per os twice daily. Pretreatment tumors were also analyzed for genetic changes in 230 genes of interest using an exon-capture approach. The high pAKT cohort was closed after no responses were seen in the first 10 patients. The incidence of low pAKT melanoma tumors was low (∼25% of melanomas tested) and this cohort was eventually closed because of poor accrual. However, among the five patients with melanoma accrued in the low pAKT cohort, there was one partial response (PR). Two other patients had near PRs before undergoing surgical resection of residual disease (one patient) or discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity (one patient). Among the two nonresponding, low pAKT patients with melanoma, co-mutations in MAP2K1, NF1, and/or EGFR were detected. Tumor regression was seen in three of five patients with BRAF-mutated, low pAKT melanomas; no responses were seen in the high pAKT cohort. These results provide rationale for co-targeting MEK and PI3K/AKT in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma whose tumors express high pAKT. However, the complexity of genetic changes in melanoma indicates that additional genetic information will be needed for optimal selection of patients likely to respond to MEK inhibitors.,,A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to targeted anticancer agents should speed the development of treatment strategies with lasting clinical efficacy. RAF inhibition in BRAF-mutant melanoma exemplifies the promise and challenge of many targeted drugs; although response rates are high, resistance invariably develops. Here, we articulate overarching principles of resistance to kinase inhibitors, as well as a translational approach to characterize resistance in the clinical setting through tumor mutation profiling. As a proof of principle, we performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 138 cancer genes in a tumor obtained from a patient with melanoma who developed resistance to PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response. The resulting profile identified an activating mutation at codon 121 in the downstream kinase MEK1 that was absent in the corresponding pretreatment tumor. The MEK1(C121S) mutation was shown to increase kinase activity and confer robust resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition in vitro. Thus, MEK1(C121S) or functionally similar mutations are predicted to confer resistance to combined MEK/RAF inhibition. These results provide an instructive framework for assessing mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition and illustrate the use of emerging technologies in a manner that may accelerate personalized cancer medicine.

We evaluated whether dovitinib (TKI258), an inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, presented antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancers. Preclinical activity of dovitinib was evaluated in both breast cancer cell lines and an FGFR1-amplified xenograft model (HBCx2). Dovitinib was then evaluated in a phase II trial that included 4 groups of patients with human EGF receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer on the basis of FGFR1 amplification and hormone receptor (HR) status. FGFR1 amplification was assessed by silver in situ hybridization. Preplanned retrospective analyses assessed predictive value of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGF3 amplifications by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Dovitinib monotherapy inhibits proliferation in FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified, but not FGFR-normal, breast cancer cell lines. Dovitinib also inhibits tumor growth in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer xenografts. Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the trial. Unconfirmed response or stable disease for more than 6 months was observed in 5 (25%) and 1 (3%) patient(s) with FGFR1-amplified/HR-positive and FGFR1-nonamplified/HR-positive breast cancer. When qPCR-identified amplifications in FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3 were grouped to define an FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer in HR-positive patients, the mean reduction in target lesions was 21.1% compared with a 12.0% increase in patients who did not present with FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer. Dovitinib showed antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancer cell lines and may have activity in breast cancers with FGF pathway amplification.;;Lucitanib is a potent, oral inhibitor fibroblast growth factor receptor types 1 and 2 (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor types 1, 2, and 3 (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor types α and β (PGFRα/β), which are essential kinases for tumor growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors. This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive). Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t½ was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients. Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.	André F. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013;;Soria JC. et al.,Ann. Oncol.,2014

Here, we report that more than 50% of human T-ALLs, including tumors from all major molecular oncogenic subtypes, have activating mutations that involve the extracellular heterodimerization domain and/or the C-terminal PEST domain of NOTCH1. These findings greatly expand the role of activated NOTCH1 in the molecular pathogenesis of human T-ALL and provide a strong rationale for targeted therapies that interfere with NOTCH signaling.,,,,Oncogenic activating mutations in NOTCH1 occur in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). In the present study, we describe a novel mechanism of NOTCH1 activation in T-ALL in which a deletion removing the 5' portion of NOTCH1 abolishes the negative regulatory control of the extracellular domain and leads to constitutively active NOTCH1 signaling. Polypeptides translated from truncated transcripts encoded by the NOTCH1 deletion allele retain the transmembrane domain of the receptor and are constitutively cleaved by the γ-secretase complex, resulting in high levels of NOTCH1 signaling that can be effectively blocked by γ-secretase inhibitors. Our results expand the spectrum of oncogenic lesions activating NOTCH1 signaling in human T-ALL.,,γ-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been proposed for combined therapies of malignancies with a dysregulated Notch signaling. GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) induces apoptosis of some tumor cells by inhibiting proteasome and Notch activity. Alterations in these two cell survival regulators contribute to apoptosis resistance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby GSI I increases apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Time-course studies indicate that initial apoptotic events are inhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic signaling, and a consistent Noxa protein up-regulation. These events precede, and some of them contribute to, mitochondrial alterations, which occur notwithstanding Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I. In CLL cells, GSI I inhibits Notch1 and Notch2 activation only in the late apoptotic phases, suggesting that this event does not initiate CLL cell apoptosis. However, Notch inhibition may contribute to amplify GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, given that Notch activation sustains the survival of these cells, as demonstrated by the evidence that both Notch1 and Notch2 down-regulation by small-interfering RNA accelerates spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis. Overall, our results show that GSI I triggers CLL cell apoptosis by inhibiting proteasome activity and enhancing ER stress, and amplifies it by blocking Notch activation. These findings suggest the potential relevance of simultaneously targeting these three important apoptosis regulators as a novel therapeutic strategy for CLL.;;Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are present in over 50% of human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Here, we report a new human T-cell lymphoma line CUTLL1, which expresses high levels of activated NOTCH1 and is extremely sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors treatment. CUTLL1 cells harbor a t(7;9)(q34;q34) translocation which induces the expression of a TCRB-NOTCH1 fusion transcript encoding a membrane-bound truncated form of the NOTCH1 receptor. GSI treatment of CUTLL1 cells blocked NOTCH1 processing and caused rapid clearance of activated intracellular NOTCH1. Loss of NOTCH1 activity induced a gene expression signature characterized by the downregulation of NOTCH1 target genes such as HES1 and NOTCH3. In contrast with most human T-ALL cell lines with activating mutations in NOTCH1, CUTLL1 cells showed a robust cellular phenotype upon GSI treatment characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. These results show that the CUTLL1 cell line has a strong dependence on NOTCH1 signaling for proliferation and survival and supports that T-ALL patients whose tumors harbor t(7;9) should be included in clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy NOTCH1 inhibition with GSIs.,,In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. A 41-year-old male with a large mediastinal mass, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy was diagnosed as having T-LBL. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD4, CD8, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, and TdT. G-banding and spectral karyotyping of pleural effusion cells showed 47,XY,dup(1)(q21q32),t(7;9)(q34;q34),+20. Genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that the 5' end of TRB@ J1-5 was connected with the middle of NOTCH1 exon 25 (434 bp downstream from its 5' end) in a 'head-to-head' configuration on the der(9)t(7;9), although nine extra bases were inserted between the two genes. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed expression of the TRB@/NOTCH1 fusion transcripts. Similarly, the 5' end of J1-5 was fused to the shortened exon 25 with nine extra bases. The NOTCH1 breakpoint in exon 25 was very close to transcription start sites of deleted Notch1 in murine T-ALL. The TRB@/NOTCH1 fusion gene with a NOTCH1 breakpoint in exon 25, which has not previously been detected in four other reported cases with t(7;9), could lead to aberrant expression of the truncated NOTCH1 by TRB@ enhancer elements. The resultant NOTCH1 receptor deleting most of the extracellular domain may be implicated in the pathogenesis of T-LBL by ligand-independent, constitutive activation of the NOTCH1 pathway, suggesting avenues for future therapy with γ-secretase inhibitors.;;Mutations in NOTCH1 are frequently detected in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and in mouse T-ALL models. Treatment of mouse or human T-ALL cell lines in vitro with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) results in growth arrest and/or apoptosis. These studies suggest GSIs as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of T-ALL. To determine whether GSIs have antileukemic activity in vivo, we treated near-end-stage Tal1/Ink4a/Arf+/- leukemic mice with vehicle or with a GSI developed by Merck (MRK-003). We found that GSI treatment significantly extended the survival of leukemic mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Notch1 target gene expression was repressed and increased numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in the GSI-treated mice, demonstrating that Notch1 inhibition in vivo induces apoptosis. T-ALL cell lines also exhibit PI3K/mTOR pathway activation, indicating that rapamycin may also have therapeutic benefit. When GSIs are administered in combination with rapamycin, mTOR kinase activity is ablated and apoptosis induced. Moreover, GSI and rapamycin treatment inhibits human T-ALL growth and extends survival in a mouse xenograft model. This work supports the idea of targeting NOTCH1 in T-ALL and suggests that inhibition of the mTOR and NOTCH1 pathways may have added efficacy.;;NOTCH signaling is deregulated in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) as a result of activating mutations in NOTCH1. Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) block proteolytic activation of NOTCH receptors and may provide a targeted therapy for T-ALL. We have investigated the mechanisms of GSI sensitivity across a panel of T-ALL cell lines, yielding an approach for patient stratification based on pathway activity and also providing a rational combination strategy for enhanced response to GSI. Whereas the NOTCH1 mutation status does not serve as a predictor of GSI sensitivity, a gene expression signature of NOTCH pathway activity does correlate with response, and may be useful in the selection of patients more likely to respond to GSI. Furthermore, inhibition of the NOTCH pathway activity signature correlates with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2D (p19(INK4d)) and CDKN1B (p27(Kip1)), leading to derepression of RB and subsequent exit from the cell cycle. Consistent with this evidence of cell cycle exit, short-term exposure of GSI resulted in sustained molecular and phenotypic effects after withdrawal of the compound. Combination treatment with GSI and a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4 produced synergistic growth inhibition, providing evidence that GSI engagement of the CDK4/RB pathway is an important mechanism of GSI action and supports further investigation of this combination for improved efficacy in treating T-ALL.;;Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that has a wide range of molecular aberrations and clinical outcomes. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to explore the landscape of gene fusions in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We observed that individual breast cancers have a variety of expressed gene fusions. We identified two classes of recurrent gene rearrangements involving genes encoding microtubule-associated serine-threonine kinase (MAST) and members of the Notch family. Both MAST and Notch-family gene fusions have substantial phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cell lines harboring Notch gene rearrangements are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of Notch signaling, and overexpression of MAST1 or MAST2 gene fusions has a proliferative effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that recurrent gene rearrangements have key roles in subsets of carcinomas and suggest that transcriptome sequencing could identify individuals with rare, targetable gene fusions.;;Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is characterized by the hallmark translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) and the resulting overexpression of cyclin D1 (CCND1). Our current knowledge of this disease encompasses frequent secondary cytogenetic aberrations and the recurrent mutation of a handful of genes, such as TP53, ATM, and CCND1. However, these findings insufficiently explain the biologic underpinnings of MCL. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. In total, 12% of clinical samples and 20% of cell lines harbored somatic NOTCH1 coding sequence mutations that clustered in the PEST domain and predominantly consisted of truncating mutations or small frame-shifting indels. NOTCH1 mutations were associated with poor overall survival (P = .003). Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of the NOTCH pathway reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in 2 MCL cell lines. In summary, we have identified recurrent NOTCH1 mutations that provide the preclinical rationale for therapeutic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway in a subset of patients with MCL.;;To identify and characterize novel, activating mutations in Notch receptors in breast cancer and to determine response to the gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) PF-03084014. We used several computational approaches, including novel algorithms, to analyze next-generation sequencing data and related omic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer cohort. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were sequenced, and Notch-mutant models were treated with PF-03084014. Gene-expression and functional analyses were performed to study the mechanism of activation through mutation and inhibition by PF-03084014. We identified mutations within and upstream of the PEST domains of NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3 in the TCGA dataset. Mutations occurred via several genetic mechanisms and compromised the function of the PEST domain, a negative regulatory domain commonly mutated in other cancers. Focal amplifications of NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 were also observed, as were heterodimerization or extracellular domain mutations at lower incidence. Mutations and amplifications often activated the Notch pathway as evidenced by increased expression of canonical Notch target genes, and functional mutations were significantly enriched in the triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TNBC). PDX models were also identified that harbored PEST domain mutations, and these models were highly sensitive to PF-03084014. This work suggests that Notch-altered breast cancer constitutes a bona fide oncogenic driver segment with the most common alteration being PEST domain mutations present in multiple Notch receptors. Importantly, functional studies suggest that this newly identified class can be targeted with Notch inhibitors, including GSIs.;;Purpose Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) represent a heterogeneous group of chemotherapy refractory tumors, with a subset demonstrating an aggressive phenotype. We investigated the molecular underpinnings of this phenotype and assessed the Notch1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Methods We genotyped 102 ACCs that had available pathologic and clinical data. Notch1 activation was assessed by immunohistochemistry for Notch1 intracellular domain. Luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm Notch1 target gene expression in vitro. The Notch1 inhibitor brontictuzumab was tested in patient-derived xenografts from patients with ACC and in a patient with ACC who was enrolled in a phase I study. Results NOTCH1 mutations occurred predominantly (14 of 15 patients) in the negative regulatory region and Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr-rich domains, the same two hotspots seen in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and led to pathway activation in vitro. NOTCH1-mutant tumors demonstrated significantly higher levels of Notch1 pathway activation than wild-type tumors on the basis of Notch1 intracellular domain staining ( P = .004). NOTCH1 mutations define a distinct aggressive ACC subgroup with a significantly higher likelihood of solid subtype ( P < .001), advanced-stage disease at diagnosis ( P = .02), higher rate of liver and bone metastasis ( P ≤ .02), shorter relapse-free survival (median, 13 v 34 months; P = .01), and shorter overall survival (median 30 v 122 months; P = .001) when compared with NOTCH1 wild-type tumors. Significant tumor growth inhibition with brontictuzumab was observed exclusively in the ACC patient-derived xenograft model that harbored a NOTCH1 activating mutation. Furthermore, an index patient with NOTCH1-mutant ACC had a partial response to brontictuzumab. Conclusion NOTCH1 mutations define a distinct disease phenotype characterized by solid histology, liver and bone metastasis, poor prognosis, and potential responsiveness to Notch1 inhibitors. Clinical studies targeting Notch1 in a genotype-defined ACC subgroup are warranted.	;;,,;;,,,,,,;;Weng AP. et al.,Science,2004,,,,Haydu JE. et al.,Blood,2012,,Rosati E. et al.,Int. J.

Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	Garner AP. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Indeed, in clinical trials, PARP1/2 inhibitors elicit sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA gene mutations. In hypothesizing that additional genetic determinants might direct use of these drugs, we conducted a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen for candidate olaparib sensitivity genes. In support of this hypothesis, the set of identified genes included known determinants of olaparib sensitivity, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes. In addition, the set included genes implicated in established networks of DNA repair, DNA cohesion, and chromatin remodeling, none of which were known previously to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition. Notably, integration of the list of candidate sensitivity genes with data from tumor DNA sequencing studies identified CDK12 deficiency as a clinically relevant biomarker of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. In models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), CDK12 attenuation was sufficient to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition, suppression of DNA repair via homologous recombination, and reduced expression of BRCA1.

Notably, however, the underlying genetic defects that give rise to HR defects in the absence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that the recurrent somatic CDK12 mutations identified in ovarian cancers impair the catalytic activity of this kinase, which is involved in the transcription of a subset of genes, including BRCA1 and other DNA repair genes. Furthermore, we show that disabling CDK12 function in ovarian cancer cells reduces BRCA1 levels, disrupts HR repair, and sensitizes these cells to the cross-linking agents melphalan and cisplatin and to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888).

Four major molecular subgroups of MB have been identified, one of which is characterized by activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Preclinical data suggest that inhibitors of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway could become valuable treatment options for patients with this subgroup of MB. Indeed, agents targeting the positive regulator of the pathway, smoothened (SMO), have demonstrated efficacy in a subset of patients with SHH MB. However, because of resistance and the presence of mutations downstream of SMO, not all patients with SHH MB respond to SMO inhibitors. The development of agents that target these resistance mechanisms and the potential for their combination with traditional chemotherapy and SHH inhibitors will be discussed. Due to its extensive molecular heterogeneity, the future of MB treatment is in personalized therapy, which may lead to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. This will include the development of clinically available tests that can efficiently discern the SHH subgroup. The preliminary use of these tests in clinical trials is also discussed herein.

Subsequent analysis has shown that constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is an important pathogenetic event in these patients, and that enzymatic inhibition of JAK2V617F may be of therapeutic benefit in this context. However, a significant proportion of patients with ET or MF are JAK2V617F-negative. We hypothesized that activation of the JAK-STAT pathway might also occur as a consequence of activating mutations in certain hematopoietic-specific cytokine receptors, including the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), or the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR). DNA sequence analysis of the exons encoding the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of EPOR, MPL, and GCSFR, and comparison with germline DNA derived from buccal swabs, identified a somatic activating mutation in the transmembrane domain of MPL (W515L) in 9% (4/45) of JAKV617F-negative MF. Expression of MPLW515L in 32D, UT7, or Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth and thrombopoietin hypersensitivity, and resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, AKT, and ERK. Furthermore, a small molecule JAK kinase inhibitor inhibited MPLW515L-mediated proliferation and JAK-STAT signaling in vitro. In a murine bone marrow transplant assay, expression of MPLW515L, but not wild-type MPL, resulted in a fully penetrant myeloproliferative disorder characterized by marked thrombocytosis (Plt count 1.9-4.0 x 10(12)/L), marked splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and increased reticulin fibrosis. Activation of JAK-STAT signaling via MPLW515L is an important pathogenetic event in patients with JAK2V617F-negative MF. The bone marrow transplant model of MPLW515L-mediated myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) exhibits certain features of human MF, including extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and megakaryocytic proliferation. Further analysis of positive and negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway is warranted in JAK2V617F-negative MPD.	Pikman Y. et al.,PLoS Med.,2006

Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C.

Inhibiting key down-stream effectors of GNAQ/11 represents a rational therapeutic approach for uveal melanomas that harbor these mutations. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK) and PI3K/AKT pathways are activated in uveal melanoma. In this study, we test the effect of the clinically relevant small molecule inhibitors GSK1120212 (MEK inhibitor) and GSK2126458 (pan class I PI3K inhibitor) on uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds. We use the largest set of genetically annotated uveal melanoma cell lines to date to carry out in vitro cellular signaling, cell-cycle regulation, growth, and apoptosis analyses. RNA interference and small molecule MEK and/or PI3K inhibitor treatment were used to determine the dependency of uveal melanoma cells with different GNAQ/11 mutation backgrounds on MEK/MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT signaling. Proteomic network analysis was done to unveil signaling alterations in response to MEK and/or PI3K small molecule inhibition. GNAQ/11 mutation status was not a determinant of whether cells would undergo cell-cycle arrest or growth inhibition to MEK and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition. A reverse correlation was observed between MAPK and AKT phosphorylation after MEK or PI3K inhibition, respectively. Neither MEK nor PI3K inhibition alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis in the majority of cell lines; however, the combination of MEK + PI3K inhibitor treatment resulted in the marked induction of apoptosis in a GNAQ/11 mutant-dependent manner. MEK + PI3K inhibition may be an effective combination therapy in uveal melanoma, given the inherent reciprocal activation of these pathways within these cells.,,Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.	;;;;Khalili JS. et al.,Clin.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.,,The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.;;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01283516.).,,To extend the results of a phase III trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinomas harboring EML4-ALK fusion. We conducted a co-clinical trial in a mouse model comparing the ALK inhibitor crizotinib to the standard-of-care cytotoxic agents docetaxel or pemetrexed. Concordant with the clinical outcome in humans, crizotinib produced a substantially higher response rate compared with chemotherapy, associated with significantly longer progression-free survival. Overall survival was also prolonged in crizotinib- compared with chemotherapy-treated mice. Pemetrexed produced superior overall survival compared with docetaxel, suggesting that this agent may be the preferred chemotherapy in the ALK population. In addition, in the EML4-ALK-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, HSP90 inhibition can overcome both primary and acquired crizotinib resistance. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition, as well as the second-generation ALK inhibitor TAE684, demonstrated activity in newly developed lung adenocarcinoma models driven by crizotinib-insensitive EML4-ALK L1196M or F1174L. Our findings suggest that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in ALK inhibitor-naïve disease and support further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors and second-generation ALK inhibitors in tumors with primary or acquired crizotinib resistance.

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.	Bresler SC. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2011

We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype. Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks. The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity. Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible. The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32). Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively. Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy. In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan. No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab. The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity. The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.

Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors.	,,Lim SM. et al.,Oncotarget,2016

We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.

Understanding these resistance mechanisms will be instrumental to improve personalized cancer treatment. Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screens were performed to identify genes implicated in resistance to HER2/PI3K/mTOR targeting agents in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines. Expression and adjuvant trastuzumab response data from the HER2+ breast cancer trials FinHer and Responsify were used to validate our findings in patient series. We find that reduced ARID1A expression confers resistance to several drugs that inhibit the HER2/PI3K/mTOR signaling cascade at different levels. We demonstrate that ARID1A loss activates annexin A1 (ANXA1) expression, which is required for drug resistance through its activation of AKT. We find that the AKT inhibitor MK2206 restores sensitivity of ARID1A knockdown breast cancer cells to both the mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 and trastuzumab. Consistent with these in vitro data, we find in two independent HER2+ breast cancer patient series that high ANXA1 expression is associated with resistance to adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Our findings provide a rationale for why tumors accumulate ARID1A mutations and identify high ANXA1 expression as a predictive biomarker for trastuzumab-based treatment.

The important role played by FLT3 in the survival and proliferation of blasts, and its overexpression in most patients with AML, make FLT3 an attractive therapeutic target. We undertook a phase 2 trial of the FLT3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib (CEP701) used as monotherapy in untreated older patients with AML not considered fit for intensive chemotherapy, irrespective of FLT3 mutation status. Lestaurtinib was administered orally for 8 weeks, initially at a dose of 60 mg twice daily, escalating to 80 mg twice daily, and was generally well tolerated. Clinical activity, manifest as transient reductions in bone marrow and peripheral-blood blasts or longer periods of transfusion independence, was seen in 3 (60%) of 5 patients with mutated FLT3 and 5 (23%) of 22 evaluable wild-type FLT3 patients. Laboratory data demonstrated that clinical responses occurred where the presence of sustained FLT3-inhibitory drug levels were combined with in vitro cytotoxic sensitivity of blasts to lestaurtinib. Further evaluation of this compound, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or other targeted agents, is warranted in both FLT3 mutant and wild-type patients.;;Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are present in approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with adverse prognosis.

Here we report compassionate-use results with the multikinase and FLT3-ITD inhibitor sorafenib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML. Sorafenib induced clinically meaningful and very rapid responses in all 6 patients treated either before (n = 2), after (n = 3), or both before and after (n = 1) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Sorafenib-induced remissions facilitated allo-SCT in 2 of the 3 refractory patients. Two of the 4 patients who were treated after allo-SCT survived 216 and 221 days, respectively, whereas the other 2 remain in ongoing complete molecular remission. Sorafenib response was associated with an inhibition of the antiapoptotic FLT3-ITD target Stat-5 in vivo. Together, sorafenib monotherapy before or after allo-SCT has remarkable clinical activity in poor risk FLT3-ITD-positive AML and deserves further evaluation in prospective clinical trials.,,Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene occurs in 30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and confers a poor prognosis. Thirteen relapsed or chemo-refractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily). Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days but the FLT3 and downstream effectors remained suppressed. Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including ALDH1A1, JAK3, and MMP15, whose functions were unknown in AML. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results. Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells (LICs) from samples before sorafenib treatment. LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance. These results suggest that sorafenib have selected more aggressive sorafenib-resistant subclones carrying both FLT3-ITD and D835 mutations, and might provide important leads to further improvement of treatment outcome with FLT3 inhibitors.;;Mutations leading to constitutive activation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3) occur in blasts of 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Midostaurin (PKC412; N-benzoylstaurosporin) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with demonstrated activity in patients with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with FLT3 mutations. Ninety-five patients with AML or MDS with either wild-type (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily. The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by ≥ 50% (BR). The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 wild-type. One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen. Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin. These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and wild-type. The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant AML.;;Effective targeted cancer therapeutic development depends upon distinguishing disease-associated 'driver' mutations, which have causative roles in malignancy pathogenesis, from 'passenger' mutations, which are dispensable for cancer initiation and maintenance. Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors, suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.,,The t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) rearrangements affecting the core-binding factors RUNX1 and CBFB, respectively, are found in 15% to 20% of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Since the expression of the fusion genes CBFB/MYH11 or RUNX1/RUNX1T1 alone is not sufficient to cause leukemia, we performed exome sequencing of an AML sample with an inv(16) to identify mutations, which may collaborate with the CBFB/MYH11 fusion during leukemogenesis. We discovered an N676K mutation in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding domain (tyrosine kinase domain 1 [TKD1]) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene. In a cohort of 84 de novo AML patients with a CBFB/MYH11 rearrangement and in 36 patients with a RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rearrangement, the FLT3 N676K mutation was identified in 5 and 1 patients, respectively (5 [6%] of 84; 1 [3%] of 36). The FLT3-N676K mutant alone leads to factor-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells and, together with a concurrent FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication), confers resistance to the FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PTKIs) PKC412 and AC220. Gene expression analysis of AML patients with CBFB/MYH11 rearrangement and FLT3 N676K mutation showed a trend toward a specific expression profile. Ours is the first report of recurring FLT3 N676 mutations in core-binding factor (CBF) leukemias and suggests a defined subgroup of CBF leukemias.;;Secondary point mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinase domain (KD) are common causes of acquired clinical resistance to the FLT3 inhibitors AC220 (quizartinib) and sorafenib. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and clinical activity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia, irrespective of BCR-ABL KD mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naïve and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted. Alternative strategies will be required for patients with TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD D835 mutations.;;Patients received 5-azacytidine (AZA) 75 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 7 days and sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously; cycles were repeated at ~1-month intervals. Forty-three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a median age of 64 years (range, 24-87 years) were enrolled; 37 were evaluable for response. FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was detected in 40 (93%) patients, with a median allelic ratio of 0.32 (range, 0.009-0.93). They had received a median of 2 prior treatment regimens (range, 0-7); 9 had failed prior therapy with a FLT3 kinase inhibitor. The response rate was 46%, including 10 (27%) complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi), 6 (16%) complete responses (CR), and 1 (3%) partial response. The median time to achieve CR/CRi was 2 cycles (range, 1-4), and the median duration of CR/CRi was 2.3 months (range, 1-14.3 months). Sixty-four percent of patients achieved adequate (defined as >85%) FLT3 inhibition during their first cycle of therapy. The degree of FLT3 inhibition correlated with plasma sorafenib concentrations. FLT3 ligand levels did not rise to levels seen in prior studies of patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. The combination of AZA and sorafenib is effective for patients with relapsed AML and FLT-3-ITD. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01254890.;;FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations are common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These patients regularly develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors suggesting that targeted combination drug strategies are needed to enhance AML therapy efficacy. Acquired point mutations of FLT3-ITD gene were screened using cDNA-based sequencing approach in vitro sorafenib-resistant cells, which were developed by long-term exposure of Ba/F3-ITD to increasing doses of sorafenib, and in FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients, who developed relapse following sorafenib therapy. Drug effects (e.g., proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and changes in signal transduction protein expression) were assessed in AML cells harboring the point mutations in vitro and in FLT3-ITD-mutated AML patient samples. We identified several acquired point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains (TKD) of the FLT3 gene in sorafenib-resistant murine leukemia cell line carrying human FLT3-ITD mutations, which were also detected in two of four sorafenib-resistant patient samples. Engineering these point mutations into Ba/F3-ITD cells generated sublines that demonstrated varying degrees of sorafenib [a type II tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)] resistance. A similar pattern of resistance could be observed by exposing these sublines to the other type II TKIs AC220 and MLN518. However, these sublines retained sensitivity to the type I TKIs PKC412 or crenolanib. The combination of crenolanib with sorafenib demonstrated marked cytotoxic effects in all of the sorafenib-resistant sublines. These combination strategies could be clinically important in reversing acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibition in AML.;;FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations are common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

These combination strategies could be clinically important in reversing acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibition in AML.;;Tyrosine kinase domain mutations are a common cause of acquired clinical resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used to treat cancer, including the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib. Mutation of kinase \"gatekeeper\" residues, which control access to an allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site, has been frequently implicated in TKI resistance. The molecular underpinnings of gatekeeper mutation-mediated resistance are incompletely understood. We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with the TKI quizartinib, which demonstrates that quizartinib binding relies on essential edge-to-face aromatic interactions with the gatekeeper F691 residue, and F830 within the highly conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif in the activation loop. This reliance makes quizartinib critically vulnerable to gatekeeper and activation loop substitutions while minimizing the impact of mutations elsewhere. Moreover, we identify PLX3397, a novel FLT3 inhibitor that retains activity against the F691L mutant due to a binding mode that depends less vitally on specific interactions with the gatekeeper position. We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with a kinase inhibitor, elucidating the structural mechanism of resistance due to the gatekeeper F691L mutation. PLX3397 is a novel FLT3 inhibitor with in vitro activity against this mutation but is vulnerable to kinase domain mutations in the FLT3 activation loop.;;We present a phase II, single-arm study evaluating 800 mg daily venetoclax, a highly selective, oral small-molecule B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibitor in patients with high-risk relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 19%; an additional 19% of patients demonstrated antileukemic activity not meeting IWG criteria (partial bone marrow response and incomplete hematologic recovery). Twelve (38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profiling was consistent with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identified potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/refractory or unfit for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profile in this phase II study. Predictive markers of response consistent with BCL2 dependence were identified. Clinical and preclinical findings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate venetoclax combined with other agents in AML.

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a. In an ex vivo tissue explant system, we found that TP53 pathway alterations (TP53 status, MDM2/MDM4 genomic amplification/mRNA overexpression, MDM2 SNP309, and TP53 SNP72) did not confer apoptotic or cytostatic responses in sarcoma tissue biopsies (n = 24). Unexpectedly, MDM2 status did not predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity. RNA sequencing revealed that the global transcriptomic profiles of these sarcomas provided a more robust prediction of apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a. Expression profiling revealed a subset of TP53 target genes that were transactivated specifically in sarcomas that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a. Of these target genes, the GADD45A promoter region was shown to be hypermethylated in 82% of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not respond to Nutlin-3a, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the innate ability of sarcomas to resist apoptotic death following Nutlin-3a treatment. Collectively, our findings argue that the existing benchmark biomarker for MDM2 antagonist efficacy (MDM2 amplification) should not be used to predict outcome but rather global gene expression profiles and epigenetic status of sarcomas dictate their sensitivity to p53/MDM2 antagonists.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response.

The purpose of this study was to determine the response rate (RR) for the selective, allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma. This was an open-label, two-stage, phase II study with two cohorts. Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily. In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed. Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.,,MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future.

In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed. Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.	Kim KB. et al.,J. Clin.

Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

Sanger sequencing of the tyrosine kinome identified mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene in 3.8% of squamous cell lung cancers and cell lines. Squamous lung cancer cell lines harboring DDR2 mutations were selectively killed by knock-down of DDR2 by RNAi or by treatment with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Tumors established from a DDR2 mutant cell line were sensitive to dasatinib in xenograft models. Expression of mutated DDR2 led to cellular transformation which was blocked by dasatinib. A squamous cell lung cancer patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation. These data suggest that gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 are important oncogenic events and are amenable to therapy with dasatinib. As dasatinib is already approved for use, these findings could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. DDR2 mutations are present in 4% of lung SCCs, and DDR2 mutations are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. These findings provide a rationale for designing clinical trials with the FDA-approved drug dasatinib in patients with lung SCCs.	Hammerman PS. et al.,Cancer Discov,2011

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

Patients with acceptable performance status (0-2), adequate organ function, and no active infection, received ruxolitinib 25 mg orally twice a day for 4 weeks (1 cycle). Response was assessed after every 2 cycles of treatment, and patients who completed 2 cycles were allowed to continue treatment until disease progression. Dose escalation to 50 mg twice daily was permitted in patients demonstrating a benefit. Thirty-eight patients, with a median age of 69 years (range, 45-88), were treated. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-6). Twelve patients had JAK2V617F mutation. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range, 1-22). Three of 18 patients with postmyeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed a significant response; 2 achieved complete remission (CR) and one achieved a CR with insufficient recovery of blood counts (CRi). The responding patients with palpable spleens also had significant reductions in spleen size. Overall, ruxolitinib was very well tolerated with only 4 patients having grade 3 or higher toxicity. Ruxolitinib has modest antileukemic activity as a single agent, particularly in patients with post-MPN AML. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00674479.;;Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is currently treated with aggressive chemotherapy that is not well tolerated in many elderly patients, hence the unmet medical need for effective therapies with less toxicity and better tolerability. Inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), JAK2 and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been tested in clinical studies, but showed only moderate single-agent activity. High efficacy of the HDACi pracinostat treating AML and synergy with the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib is demonstrated. Both compounds inhibit JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling in AML cells with JAK2(V617F) mutations, but also diminish FLT3 signaling, particularly in FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) cell lines. In vitro, this combination led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The synergy translated in vivo in two different AML models, the SET-2 megakaryoblastic AML mouse model carrying a JAK2(V617F) mutation, and the MOLM-13 model of FLT3-ITD-driven AML. Pracinostat and pacritinib in combination showed synergy on tumor growth, reduction of metastases and synergistically decreased JAK2 or FLT signaling, depending on the cellular context. In addition, several plasma cytokines/growth factors/chemokines triggered by the tumor growth were normalized, providing a rationale for combination therapy with an HDACi and a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML patients, particularly those with FLT3 or JAK2 mutations.	;;Eghtedar A. et al.,Blood,2012;;Novotny-Diermayr V. et al.,Blood Cancer J,2012

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN.

This study aimed to evaluate androgen signaling in bone marrow-infiltrating cancer and testosterone in blood and bone marrow and to correlate with clinical observations. This was an open-label, observational study of 57 patients with bone-metastatic CRPC who underwent transiliac bone marrow biopsy between October 2007 and March 2010. Patients received oral abiraterone acetate (1 g) once daily and prednisone (5 mg) twice daily. Androgen receptor (AR) and CYP17 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry, testosterone concentration by mass spectrometry, AR copy number by polymerase chain reaction, and TMPRSS2-ERG status by fluorescent in situ hybridization in available tissues. Median overall survival was 555 days (95% CI, 440 to 965+ days). Maximal prostate-specific antigen decline ≥ 50% occurred in 28 (50%) of 56 patients. Homogeneous, intense nuclear expression of AR, combined with ≥ 10% CYP17 tumor expression, was correlated with longer time to treatment discontinuation (> 4 months) in 25 patients with tumor-infiltrated bone marrow samples. Pretreatment CYP17 tumor expression ≥ 10% was correlated with increased bone marrow aspirate testosterone. Blood and bone marrow aspirate testosterone concentrations declined to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels and remained suppressed at progression. The observed pretreatment androgen-signaling signature is consistent with persistent androgen signaling in CRPC bone metastases. This is the first evidence that abiraterone acetate achieves sustained suppression of testosterone in both blood and bone marrow aspirate to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels. Potential admixture of blood with bone marrow aspirate limits our ability to determine the origin of measured testosterone.;;Enzalutamide is a novel antiandrogen with proven efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To evaluate enzalutamide's effects on cancer and on androgens in blood and bone marrow, and associate these with clinical observations. In this prospective phase 2 study, 60 patients with bone mCRPC received enzalutamide 160mg orally daily and had transilial bone marrow biopsies before treatment and at 8 wk of treatment. Androgen signaling components (androgen receptor [AR], AR splice variant 7 (ARV7), v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog [ERG], cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 [CYP17]) and molecules implicated in mCRPC progression (phospho-Met, phospho-Src, glucocorticoid receptor, Ki67) were assessed by immunohistochemistry; testosterone, cortisol, and androstenedione concentrations were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; AR copy number was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive statistics were applied. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 22 wk (95% confidence interval, 19.9-29.6). Twenty-two (37%) patients exhibited primary resistance to enzalutamide, discontinuing treatment within 4 mo. Maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% occurred in 27 (45%) and 13 (22%) patients, respectively. Following 8 wk of treatment, bone marrow and circulating testosterone levels increased. Pretreatment tumor nuclear AR overexpression (> 75%) and CYP17 (> 10%) expression were associated with benefit (p = 0.018). AR subcellular localization shift from the nucleus was confirmed in eight paired samples (with PSA decline) of 23 evaluable paired samples. Presence of an ARV7 variant was associated with primary resistance to enzalutamide (p = 0.018). Limited patient numbers warrant further validation. The observed subcellular shift of AR from the nucleus and increased testosterone concentration provide the first evidence in humans that enzalutamide suppresses AR signaling while inducing an adaptive feedback. Persistent androgen signaling in mCRPC was predictive of benefit and ARV7 was associated with primary resistance. We report a first bone biopsy study in metastatic prostate cancer in humans that searched for predictors of outcome of enzalutamide therapy. Benefit is linked to a pretreatment androgen-signaling signature. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01091103.	Efstathiou E. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012;;Efstathiou E. et al.,Eur. Urol.,2015

Few determinants that regulate metastasis development have been identified. The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR4 is highly expressed in RMS tissue, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis, although its functional importance has not been defined. Here, we report the identification of mutations in FGFR4 in human RMS tumors that lead to its activation and present evidence that it functions as an oncogene in RMS. Higher FGFR4 expression in RMS tumors was associated with advanced-stage cancer and poor survival, while FGFR4 knockdown in a human RMS cell line reduced tumor growth and experimental lung metastases when the cells were transplanted into mice. Moreover, 6 FGFR4 tyrosine kinase domain mutations were found among 7 of 94 (7.5%) primary human RMS tumors. The mutants K535 and E550 increased autophosphorylation, Stat3 signaling, tumor proliferation, and metastatic potential when expressed in a murine RMS cell line. These mutants also transformed NIH 3T3 cells and led to an enhanced metastatic phenotype. Finally, murine RMS cell lines expressing the K535 and E550 FGFR4 mutants were substantially more susceptible to apoptosis in the presence of a pharmacologic FGFR inhibitor than the control cell lines expressing the empty vector or wild-type FGFR4. Together, our results demonstrate that mutationally activated FGFR4 acts as an oncogene, and these are what we believe to be the first known mutations in a receptor tyrosine kinase in RMS. These findings support the potential therapeutic targeting of FGFR4 in RMS.,,Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Despite advances in modern therapy, patients with relapsed or metastatic disease have a very poor clinical prognosis. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4) is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in normal myogenesis and muscle regeneration, but not commonly expressed in differentiated muscle tissues. Amplification and mutational activation of FGFR4 has been reported in RMS and promotes tumor progression. Therefore, FGFR4 is a tractable therapeutic target for patients with RMS. In this study, we used a chimeric Ba/F3 TEL-FGFR4 construct to test five tyrosine kinase inhibitors reported to specifically inhibit FGFRs in the nanomolar range. We found ponatinib (AP24534) to be the most potent FGFR4 inhibitor with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. Ponatinib inhibited the growth of RMS cells expressing wild-type or mutated FGFR4 through increased apoptosis. Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutated FGFR4 as well as its downstream target STAT3 was also suppressed by ponatinib. Finally, ponatinib treatment inhibited tumor growth in a RMS mouse model expressing mutated FGFR4. Therefore, our data suggests that ponatinib is a potentially effective therapeutic agent for RMS tumors that are driven by a dysregulated FGFR4 signaling pathway.	Taylor JG. et al.,J. Clin.

Hyperactive JAK/STAT and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is common in this high-risk subset. We, therefore, investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in xenograft models of 8 pediatric B-ALL cases with and without CRLF2 and JAK genomic lesions. Ruxolitinib treatment yielded significantly lower peripheral blast counts compared with vehicle (P < .05) in 6 of 8 human leukemia xenografts and lower splenic blast counts (P < .05) in 8 of 8 samples. Enhanced responses to ruxolitinib were observed in samples harboring JAK-activating lesions and higher levels of STAT5 phosphorylation. Rapamycin controlled leukemia burden in all 8 B-ALL samples. Survival analysis of 2 representative B-ALL xenografts demonstrated prolonged survival with rapamycin treatment compared with vehicle (P < .01). These data demonstrate preclinical in vivo efficacy of ruxolitinib and rapamycin in this high-risk B-ALL subtype, for which novel treatments are urgently needed, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeted kinase inhibition in Ph-like ALL.,,Children with Down's syndrome have a greatly increased risk of acute megakaryoblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia in Down's syndrome is characterised by a somatic mutation in GATA1. Constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway occurs in several haematopoietic malignant diseases. We tested the hypothesis that mutations in JAK2 might be a common molecular event in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia associated with Down's syndrome. JAK2 DNA mutational analysis was done on diagnostic bone marrow samples obtained from 88 patients with Down's syndrome-associated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; and 216 patients with sporadic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Down's syndrome-associated acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, and essential thrombocythaemia. Functional consequences of identified mutations were studied in mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells. Somatically acquired JAK2 mutations were identified in 16 (18%) patients with Down's syndrome-associated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The only patient with non-Down's syndrome-associated leukaemia but with a JAK2 mutation had an isochromosome 21q. Children with a JAK2 mutation were younger (mean [SE] age 4.5 years [0.86] vs 8.6 years [0.59], p<0.0001) at diagnosis. Five mutant alleles were identified, each affecting a highly conserved arginine residue (R683). These mutations immortalised primary mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro, and caused constitutive Jak/Stat activation and cytokine-independent growth of BaF3 cells, which was sensitive to pharmacological inhibition with JAK inhibitor I. In modelling studies of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain, R683 was situated in an exposed conserved region separated from the one implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. A specific genotype-phenotype association exists between the type of somatic mutation within the JAK2 pseudokinase domain and the development of B-lymphoid or myeloid neoplasms. Somatically acquired R683 JAK2 mutations define a distinct acute lymphoblastic leukaemia subgroup that is uniquely associated with trisomy 21. JAK2 inhibitors could be useful for treatment of this leukaemia.

Mechanisms of immune escape in this context are unknown. We analyzed biopsy samples from paired baseline and relapsing lesions in four patients with metastatic melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression in response to anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease progression months to years later. Whole-exome sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the acquired resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients, revealed resistance-associated loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding interferon-receptor-associated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the wild-type allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the antigen-presenting protein beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncating mutations resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including insensitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. The B2M truncating mutation led to loss of surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I. In this study, acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in patients with melanoma was associated with defects in the pathways involved in interferon-receptor signaling and in antigen presentation. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).;;Loss-of-function mutations in JAK1/2 can lead to acquired resistance to anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. We reasoned that they may also be involved in primary resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. JAK1/2-inactivating mutations were noted in tumor biopsies of 1 of 23 patients with melanoma and in 1 of 16 patients with mismatch repair-deficient colon cancer treated with PD-1 blockade. Both cases had a high mutational load but did not respond to anti-PD-1 therapy. Two out of 48 human melanoma cell lines had JAK1/2 mutations, which led to a lack of PD-L1 expression upon interferon gamma exposure mediated by an inability to signal through the interferon gamma receptor pathway. JAK1/2 loss-of-function alterations in The Cancer Genome Atlas confer adverse outcomes in patients. We propose that JAK1/2 loss-of-function mutations are a genetic mechanism of lack of reactive PD-L1 expression and response to interferon gamma, leading to primary resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. A key functional result from somatic JAK1/2 mutations in a cancer cell is the inability to respond to interferon gamma by expressing PD-L1 and many other interferon-stimulated genes. These mutations result in a genetic mechanism for the absence of reactive PD-L1 expression, and patients harboring such tumors would be unlikely to respond to PD-1 blockade therapy.

Here we assess the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib as therapy for patients with JAK2-rearrangement associated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Ruxolitinib-treated Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL3 independence by ETV6-JAK2 showed reduced proliferation and survival (IC(50) = 370 nM) compared with KG1A or Ba/F3 cells transformed by BCR-ABL1, SPBN1-FLT3 and ZMYM2-FGFR1 (IC(50) > 10 μM for all). Inhibition was associated with reduced phosphorylation of ETV6-JAK2, ERK, STAT5 and AKT. Primary cell growth from 2 patients with JAK2 rearrangement and one patient with JAK2 amplification was assessed in methylcellulose assays. Reduced colony growth was seen for all patients in ruxolitinib-treated cultures compared with healthy controls (n=7). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed reduced growth of JAK2-rearrangement positive colonies compared to JAK2-rearrangement negative colonies. Our data, therefore, provide evidence that ruxolitinib is a promising therapy for treatment of patients with JAK2 fusion genes.,,;;Amplifications at 9p24 have been identified in breast cancer and other malignancies, but the genes within this locus causally associated with oncogenicity or tumor progression remain unclear. Targeted next-generation sequencing of postchemotherapy triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) identified a group of 9p24-amplified tumors, which contained focal amplification of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. These patients had markedly inferior recurrence-free and overall survival compared to patients with TNBC without JAK2 amplification. Detection of JAK2/9p24 amplifications was more common in chemotherapy-treated TNBCs than in untreated TNBCs or basal-like cancers, or in other breast cancer subtypes. Similar rates of JAK2 amplification were confirmed in patient-derived TNBC xenografts. In patients for whom longitudinal specimens were available, JAK2 amplification was selected for during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and eventual metastatic spread, suggesting a role in tumorigenicity and chemoresistance, phenotypes often attributed to a cancer stem cell-like cell population. In TNBC cell lines with JAK2 copy gains or amplification, specific inhibition of JAK2 signaling reduced mammosphere formation and cooperated with chemotherapy in reducing tumor growth in vivo. In these cells, inhibition of JAK1-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling had little effect or, in some cases, counteracted JAK2-specific inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that JAK2-specific inhibitors are more efficacious than dual JAK1/2 inhibitors against JAK2-amplified TNBCs. Furthermore, JAK2 amplification is a potential biomarker for JAK2 dependence, which, in turn, can be used to select patients for clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors.;;Approximately 75% of objective responses to anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with melanoma are durable, lasting for years, but delayed relapses have been noted long after initial objective tumor regression despite continuous therapy.

Pre-existing cells with increased MET gene copy number in the archival tumor tissue likely underwent clonal expansion during treatment, leading to the emergence of MET amplification in the rebiopsy taken at progression. In BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cells, ectopic expression of MET conferred resistance to panitumumab and vemurafenib, which was overcome by combining BRAF and MET inhibition. Based on tumor genotyping and functional in vitro data, the patient was treated with the dual ALK-MET inhibitor crizotinib plus vemurafenib, thus switching to dual MET and BRAF blockade, with rapid and marked effectiveness of such strategy. Although acquired resistance is a major limitation to the clinical efficacy of anticancer agents, the identification of molecular targets emerging during the first treatment may afford the opportunity to design the next line of targeted therapies, maximizing patient benefit.

Pre-existing cells with increased MET gene copy number in the archival tumor tissue likely underwent clonal expansion during treatment, leading to the emergence of MET amplification in the rebiopsy taken at progression. In BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cells, ectopic expression of MET conferred resistance to panitumumab and vemurafenib, which was overcome by combining BRAF and MET inhibition. Based on tumor genotyping and functional in vitro data, the patient was treated with the dual ALK-MET inhibitor crizotinib plus vemurafenib, thus switching to dual MET and BRAF blockade, with rapid and marked effectiveness of such strategy. Although acquired resistance is a major limitation to the clinical efficacy of anticancer agents, the identification of molecular targets emerging during the first treatment may afford the opportunity to design the next line of targeted therapies, maximizing patient benefit.

HER2 proteins were qualitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of primary tumor core biopsies, and TOP2A gene amplification levels of HER2 over-expressing cases were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Overall pathological complete response rate (pCR) was achieved in 14.3 %. HER2 was over expressed in 80/309 (25.9 %) cases, of which 61/80 cases have been tested for their TOP2A status. Over expression of HER2 was significantly positively correlated with higher pCR rates compared to low HER2 expression (27.5 % vs. 9.6 %, P < 0.001). Concurrent high TOP2A amplification led to a significantly higher pCR rate compared to low or no TOP2A amplification (56.3 % vs. 13.8 %, P = 0.001). HER2 over expression was associated with a significantly higher pCR rate only when TOP2A was also amplified (56.3 % vs. 9.6 %, P < 0.001), but not when it was deleted or normal (13.8 % vs. 9.6 %, P = 0.183) compared to HER2 low-expressing tumors. The interaction between HER2 or TOP2A and anthracycline-based regimen was observed in IDD and conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapies. The TOP2A amplification is related to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy sensitivity, and TOP2A should be included in future studies in breast cancer as a predictive marker.

A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring an LMNA-NTRK1 rearrangement displayed a remarkable response to treatment with entrectinib, which was followed by the emergence of resistance. To characterize the molecular bases of the patient's relapse, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was collected longitudinally during treatment, and a tissue biopsy, obtained before entrectinib treatment, was transplanted in mice (xenopatient), which then received the same entrectinib regimen until resistance developed. Genetic profiling of ctDNA and xenopatient samples showed acquisition of two point mutations in the catalytic domain of NTRK1, p.G595R and p.G667C. Biochemical and pharmacologic analysis in multiple preclinical models confirmed that either mutation renders the TRKA kinase insensitive to entrectinib. These findings can be immediately exploited to design next-generation TRKA inhibitors. We provide proof of principle that analyses of xenopatients (avatar) and liquid biopsies allow the identification of drug resistance mechanisms in parallel with clinical treatment of an individual patient. We describe for the first time that p.G595R and p.G667C TRKA mutations drive acquired resistance to entrectinib in colorectal cancers carrying NTRK1 rearrangements.	Russo M. et al.,Cancer Discov,2016

Deregulation of cell cycle kinases, e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can initiate a hyper-proliferative cell phenotype and cause genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation. Pharmacological agents targeting CDKs have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents for over 20 years, evolving from early pan-CDK inhibitors to second-generation inhibitors with much greater specificity and selectivity. Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful preclinical investigations, CDK inhibitors have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical trials.

However, some patients who fail CRT may miss the chance to be cured by cystectomy. Therefore, it is important to select patients with MIBC who are expected to have a good response to CRT. Several reports indicate that the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) gene is associated with resistance to cisplatin and radiation therapy. In this study, we examined the correlation between ERCC1 and CRT in vitro and in vivo in bladder cancer. Bladder cancer cell lines T24, 5637, Cl8-2 (multidrug-resistant subline of T24), and CDDP10-3 (cisplatin-resistant subline of T24) were used for in vitro assays to measure ERCC1 expression level and growth inhibition with cisplatin or ionizing radiation (IR). We then examined by immunohistochemistry that whether ERCC1 nuclear staining correlates with the efficacy of CRT using cisplatin in 22 patients with MIBC. Cl8-2 cells expressed ERCC1 mRNA 5.96-fold higher than did T24. Cl8-2 and CDDP10-3 were more resistant to cisplatin or IR than was T24. Resistance to IR, but not to cisplatin, was removed by suppressing ERCC1 using siRNA in both Cl8-2 and CDDP10-3 cells. In immunohistochemistry with ERCC1, 6 of 8 positive cases did not have complete response to CRT, whereas 12 of 14 negative cases had complete response. Sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 85.7%, respectively (P = 0.008). Although further study is needed, ERCC1 expression level may predict the efficacy of CRT for MIBC.;;Platinum compounds are the foundation of chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite poor response rates and limited response duration. It has been reported that tumor expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), a key component in nucleotide excision repair, may correlate with clinical response to platinum agents. We found that most primary lung tumor specimens demonstrated a stronger protein expression of poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerases 1 (PARP1) than their normal counterparts. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining PARP inhibition with platinum compounds may be an approach to improve platinum-based therapy for NSCLC. Drug combination experiments revealed that two distinct PARP inhibitors, olaparib and veliparib, not only potentiated the cell killing by cisplatin but also conferred cytotoxicity as a single agent specifically in ERCC1-low HCC827 and PC9 but not in ERCC1-high A549 and H157 lung cancer cells. Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of ERCC1 in A549 and H157 cells increased their sensitivities to both cisplatin and olaparib in a synergistic manner in our model. Furthermore, mechanistic studies indicated that combined PARP inhibitor and cisplatin could lead to sustained DNA double-strand breaks, prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest with distinct activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling and more pronounced apoptosis preferentially in lung cancer cells with low ERCC1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that there is a synergistic relationship between PARP inhibition and low ERCC1 expression in NSCLC that could be exploited for novel therapeutic approaches in lung cancer therapy based on tumor ERCC1 expression.,,Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a DNA repair enzyme that is frequently defective in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although low ERCC1 expression correlates with platinum sensitivity, the clinical effectiveness of platinum therapy is limited, highlighting the need for alternative treatment strategies. To discover new mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for ERCC1-defective tumours, we performed high-throughput drug screens in an isogenic NSCLC model of ERCC1 deficiency and dissected the mechanism underlying ERCC1-selective effects by studying molecular biomarkers of tumour cell response. The high-throughput screens identified multiple clinical poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitors, such as olaparib (AZD-2281), niraparib (MK-4827) and BMN 673, as being selective for ERCC1 deficiency. We observed that ERCC1-deficient cells displayed a significant delay in double-strand break repair associated with a profound and prolonged G₂/M arrest following PARP1/2 inhibitor treatment. Importantly, we found that ERCC1 isoform 202, which has recently been shown to mediate platinum sensitivity, also modulated PARP1/2 sensitivity. A PARP1/2 inhibitor-synthetic lethal siRNA screen revealed that ERCC1 deficiency was epistatic with homologous recombination deficiency. However, ERCC1-deficient cells did not display a defect in RAD51 foci formation, suggesting that ERCC1 might be required to process PARP1/2 inhibitor-induced DNA lesions before DNA strand invasion. PARP1 silencing restored PARP1/2 inhibitor resistance in ERCC1-deficient cells but had no effect in ERCC1-proficient cells, supporting the hypothesis that PARP1 might be required for the ERCC1 selectivity of PARP1/2 inhibitors.

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.	Bresler SC. et al.,Sci Transl Med,2011

Although B- or C-RAF dysregulation represents prominent resistance mechanisms, resistance-associated point mutations in RAF oncoproteins are surprisingly rare. To gain insights herein, we conducted random mutagenesis screens to identify B- or C-RAF mutations that confer resistance to RAF inhibitors. Whereas bona fide B-RAF(V600E) resistance alleles were rarely observed, we identified multiple C-RAF mutations that produced biochemical and pharmacologic resistance. Potent C-RAF resistance alleles localized to a 14-3-3 consensus binding site or a separate site within the P loop. These mutations elicited paradoxical upregulation of RAF kinase activity in a dimerization-dependent manner following exposure to RAF inhibitors.

We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.	Choudhury NJ. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016

Patients and Methods Fifty-eight patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. The primary end point was safety; secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Tumor biopsies and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were collected in the majority of patients to identify predictive biomarkers of response. Results In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of five lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.9 months), 6.6 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 8.3 months), and 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 12.8 months) in patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively.

Conclusion This study provides the first clinical data that AKT1 E17K is a therapeutic target in human cancer. The genomic context of the AKT1 E17K mutation further conditioned response to AZD5363.;;The phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding function of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is essential for the activation of oncogenic Akt/PKB kinase. Following the PIP3-mediated activation at the membrane, the activated Akt is subjected to other regulatory events, including ubiquitination-mediated deactivation. Here, by identifying and characterizing an allosteric inhibitor, SC66, we show that the facilitated ubiquitination effectively terminates Akt signaling. Mechanistically, SC66 manifests a dual inhibitory activity that directly interferes with the PH domain binding to PIP3 and facilitates Akt ubiquitination. A known PH domain-dependent allosteric inhibitor, which stabilizes Akt, prevents the SC66-induced Akt ubiquitination. A cancer-relevant Akt1 (e17k) mutant is unstable, making it intrinsically sensitive to functional inhibition by SC66 in cellular contexts in which the PI3K inhibition has little inhibitory effect. As a result of its dual inhibitory activity, SC66 manifests a more effective growth suppression of transformed cells that contain a high level of Akt signaling, compared with other inhibitors of PIP3/Akt pathway. Finally, we show the anticancer activity of SC66 by using a soft agar assay as well as a mouse xenograft tumor model. In conclusion, in this study, we not only identify a dual-function Akt inhibitor, but also demonstrate that Akt ubiquitination could be chemically exploited to effectively facilitate its deactivation, thus identifying an avenue for pharmacological intervention in Akt signaling.,,Although AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1) kinase is a central member of possibly the most frequently activated proliferation and survival pathway in cancer, mutation of AKT1 has not been widely reported. Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.,,The protein kinase v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), a key regulator of cell survival and proliferation, is frequently hyperactivated in human cancers. Intramolecular pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-kinase domain (KD) interactions are important in maintaining AKT in an inactive state. AKT activation proceeds after a conformational change that dislodges the PH from the KD. To understand these autoinhibitory interactions, we generated mutations at the PH-KD interface and found that most of them lead to constitutive activation of AKT. Such mutations are likely another mechanism by which activation may occur in human cancers and other diseases. In support of this likelihood, we found somatic mutations in AKT1 at the PH-KD interface that have not been previously described in human cancers. Furthermore, we show that the AKT1 somatic mutants are constitutively active, leading to oncogenic signaling. Additionally, our studies show that the AKT1 mutants are not effectively inhibited by allosteric AKT inhibitors, consistent with the requirement for an intact PH-KD interface for allosteric inhibition. These results have important implications for therapeutic intervention in patients with AKT mutations at the PH-KD interface.,,;;BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy leads to remarkable anti melanoma responses, but the initial tumor shrinkage is commonly incomplete, providing a nidus for subsequent disease progression. Adaptive signaling may underlie early BRAFi resistance and influence the selection pattern for genetic variants, causing late, acquired resistance. We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy. ;;The clinical impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not been described. We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of NGS in the routine care of patients with HNSCC and to correlate genomic alterations with clinical outcomes. Single-center study examining targeted NGS platform used to sequence tumor DNA obtained from 213 HNSCC patients evaluated in outpatient head and neck oncology clinic between August 2011 and December 2014. We correlated tumor genomic profiling results with clinical outcomes. PI3K/RTK pathway activation occurred frequently [activating PIK3CA mutation or amplification (13%), PTEN inactivation (3%), RAS activation (6%), EGFR or ERBB2 activation (9%)]. Alterations in pathways affecting cell-cycle regulation [CCND1 amplification (9%), CDKN2A inactivation (17%), BRCA2 inactivation (2%)] and squamous differentiation [NOTCH1 inactivation (8%) andEP300 inactivation (6%)] were identified. PIK3CA amplification (n = 43), not PIK3CA mutation, was associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0006). Oncogenic RAS mutations (n = 13) were associated with significantly poorer progression-free survival (P = 0.0001) and lower overall survival (P = 0.003). Eight patients with advanced, treatment-refractory HNSCC enrolled on clinical trials matched to tumor profiling results, and 50% achieved a partial response. Incorporation of NGS clinical assays into the routine care of patients with HNSCC is feasible and may readily facilitate enrollment into clinical trials of targeted therapy with a higher likelihood of success. Data can be utilized for discovery of genomic biomarkers of outcome. PIK3CA amplification and RAS mutations were frequently identified and associated with poorer prognosis in this cohort.

Identification of molecular biomarkers that predict benefit could guide clinical development. Fixed primary tissue and whole blood were collected prospectively from patients enrolled on GOG 248. DNA was isolated from macro-dissected tumors and blood; next-generation sequence analysis was performed on a panel of cancer related genes. Associations between clinical outcomes [response rate (RR) 20%; progression-free survival (PFS) median 4.9months] and mutations (PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, KRAS, CTNNB1, AKT1, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, FBXW7) were explored. Sequencing data was obtained from tumors of 55 of the 73 enrolled pts. Mutation rates were consistent with published reports: mutations in PTEN (45%), PIK3CA (29%), PIK3R1 (24%), K-RAS (16%), CTNNB1 (18%) were common and mutations in AKT1 (4%), TSC1 (2%), TSC2 (2%), NF1 (9%) and FBXW7 (4%) were less common. Increased PFS (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.01-0.78) and RR (response difference 0.83; 95% CI 0.03-0.99) were noted for AKT1 mutation. An increase in PFS (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.20-0.97) but not RR (response difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.34-0.34) was identified for CTNNB1 mutation. Both patients with TSC mutations had an objective response. There were no statistically significant associations between mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, PIK3R1, or KRAS and PFS or RR. Mutations in AKT1, TSC1 and TSC2 are rare, but may predict clinical benefit from temsirolimus. CTNNB1 mutations were associated with longer PFS on temsirolimus.	,,Hyman DM. et al.,J. Clin.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor.

Here, we articulate overarching principles of resistance to kinase inhibitors, as well as a translational approach to characterize resistance in the clinical setting through tumor mutation profiling. As a proof of principle, we performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 138 cancer genes in a tumor obtained from a patient with melanoma who developed resistance to PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response. The resulting profile identified an activating mutation at codon 121 in the downstream kinase MEK1 that was absent in the corresponding pretreatment tumor. The MEK1(C121S) mutation was shown to increase kinase activity and confer robust resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition in vitro. Thus, MEK1(C121S) or functionally similar mutations are predicted to confer resistance to combined MEK/RAF inhibition. These results provide an instructive framework for assessing mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition and illustrate the use of emerging technologies in a manner that may accelerate personalized cancer medicine.;;The high frequency of activating RAS or BRAF mutations in cancer provides strong rationale for targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors. ;;MEK1 mutations in melanoma can confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors, although preexisting MEK1(P124) mutations do not preclude clinical responses. We sought to determine whether recurrent, preexisting MEK1(P124) mutations affected clinical outcome in BRAF inhibitor-treated patients with melanoma. Data from four published datasets were analyzed to determine whether preexisting MEK1(P124) mutations affect radiologic response or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. The effects of MEK1(P124) mutations on MAPK pathway activity and response to BRAF inhibition were also investigated in a series of cell models. In a pooled analysis of 123 patients, the presence of a pretreatment MEK1(P124) mutation (N = 12, 10%) was associated with a poorer RECIST response (33% vs. 72% in MEK1(P124Q/S) vs. MEK1(P124) wild-type, P = 0.018), and a shorter PFS (median 3.1 vs. 4.8 months, P = 0.004). Furthermore, MEK1(P124Q/S) mutations were shown to have independent kinase activity and introduction of these mutations into a BRAF-mutant melanoma cell line diminished inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by dabrafenib and enhanced clonogenic survival in the presence of dabrafenib compared with cells ectopically expressing wild-type MEK1. Consistent with these data, two BRAF-mutant cell lines with endogenous MEK1(P124) mutations showed intermediate sensitivity to dabrafenib, but were highly sensitive to downstream inhibition of MEK or ERK. Taken together, our data indicate that preexisting MEK1(P124) mutations are associated with a reduced response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and identify a subset of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma likely to benefit from combination therapies involving MEK or ERK inhibitors.;;MEK1 mutations in melanoma can confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors, although preexisting MEK1(P124) mutations do not preclude clinical responses.

The molecular profile of CRC is routinely assessed in surgical or bioptic samples. Genotyping of CRC tissue has inherent limitations; a tissue sample represents a single snapshot in time, and it is subjected to spatial selection bias owing to tumor heterogeneity. Repeated tissue samples are difficult to obtain and cannot be used for dynamic monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy. We exploited circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to genotype colorectal tumors and track clonal evolution during treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. We identified alterations in ctDNA of patients with primary or acquired resistance to EGFR blockade in the following genes: KRAS, NRAS, MET, ERBB2, FLT3, EGFR and MAP2K1. Mutated KRAS clones, which emerge in blood during EGFR blockade, decline upon withdrawal of EGFR-specific antibodies, indicating that clonal evolution continues beyond clinical progression. Pharmacogenomic analysis of CRC cells that had acquired resistance to cetuximab reveals that upon antibody withdrawal KRAS clones decay, whereas the population regains drug sensitivity. ctDNA profiles of individuals who benefit from multiple challenges with anti-EGFR antibodies exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS. These results indicate that the CRC genome adapts dynamically to intermittent drug schedules and provide a molecular explanation for the efficacy of rechallenge therapies based on EGFR blockade. ;;No effective systemic therapy exists for patients with metastatic low-grade serous (LGS) ovarian cancers. BRAF and KRAS mutations are common in serous borderline (SB) and LGS ovarian cancers, and MEK inhibition has been shown to induce tumor regression in a minority of patients; however, no correlation has been observed between mutation status and clinical response. With the goal of identifying biomarkers of sensitivity to MEK inhibitor treatment, we performed an outlier analysis of a patient who experienced a complete, durable, and ongoing (> 5 years) response to selumetinib, a non-ATP competitive MEK inhibitor. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze this patient's tumor as well as an additional 28 SB/LGS tumors. Functional characterization of an identified novel alteration of interest was performed. Analysis of the extraordinary responder's tumor identified a 15-nucleotide deletion in the negative regulatory helix of the MAP2K1 gene encoding for MEK1. Functional characterization demonstrated that this mutant induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation, promoted anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in mice, and retained sensitivity to selumetinib. Analysis of additional LGS/SB tumors identified mutations predicted to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation in 82% (23 of 28), including two patients with BRAF fusions, one of whom achieved an ongoing complete response to MEK inhibitor-based combination therapy. Alterations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are present in the majority of patients with LGS ovarian cancer. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed deletions and fusions that are not detected by older sequencing approaches. These findings, coupled with the observation that a subset of patients with recurrent LGS ovarian cancer experienced dramatic and durable responses to MEK inhibitor therapy, support additional clinical studies of MEK inhibitors in this disease.

Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from 39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x. Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%) patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1; n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted only in patients without clinical benefit. Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors.	,,Lim SM. et al.,Oncotarget,2016

To design new lines of treatment, the molecular landscape of resistant tumors must be ascertained. We investigated the role of mutations in the EGFR signaling axis on the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab in patients and cellular models. Tissue samples were obtained from 37 patients with colorectal cancer who became refractory to cetuximab. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance. The genetic profile of tumor specimens obtained after cetuximab treatment revealed the emergence of a complex pattern of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes, including two novel EGFR ectodomain mutations (R451C and K467T). Mutational profiling of cetuximab-resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR alleles: S464L, G465R, and I491M. Structurally, these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for the R451C mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab. Colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signaling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding. Both mechanisms of resistance may occur concomitantly. Our data have implications for designing additional lines of therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who relapse upon treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.	Arena S. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015

We studied EGFR blockade in colorectal cancer to assess whether tissue and liquid biopsies can be integrated with radiologic imaging to monitor the impact of individual oncogenic alterations on lesion-specific responses. Biopsy of a patient's progressing liver metastasis following prolonged response to cetuximab revealed a MEK1(K57T) mutation as a novel mechanism of acquired resistance. This lesion regressed upon treatment with panitumumab and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. In circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), mutant MEK1 levels declined with treatment, but a previously unrecognized KRAS(Q61H) mutation was also identified that increased despite therapy. This same KRAS mutation was later found in a separate nonresponding metastasis. In summary, parallel analyses of tumor biopsies and serial ctDNA monitoring show that lesion-specific radiographic responses to subsequent targeted therapies can be driven by distinct resistance mechanisms arising within separate tumor lesions in the same patient. Molecular heterogeneity ensuing from acquired resistance drives lesion-specific responses to subsequent targeted therapies. Analysis of a single-lesion biopsy is inadequate to guide selection of subsequent targeted therapies. ctDNA profiles allow the detection of concomitant resistance mechanisms residing in separate metastases and assessment of the effect of therapies designed to overcome resistance.

It is of unknown cause. Recent reports of responses to imatinib in patients with the syndrome suggested that an activated kinase such as ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), or KIT, all of which are inhibited by imatinib, might be the cause. We treated 11 patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome with imatinib and identified the molecular basis for the response. Nine of the 11 patients treated with imatinib had responses lasting more than three months in which the eosinophil count returned to normal. One such patient had a complex chromosomal abnormality, leading to the identification of a fusion of the Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) gene to the PDGFRalpha (PDGFRA) gene generated by an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that transforms hematopoietic cells and is inhibited by imatinib (50 percent inhibitory concentration, 3.2 nM). The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene was subsequently detected in 9 of 16 patients with the syndrome and in 5 of the 9 patients with responses to imatinib that lasted more than three months. Relapse in one patient correlated with the appearance of a T674I mutation in PDGFRA that confers resistance to imatinib. The hypereosinophilic syndrome may result from a novel fusion tyrosine kinase - FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha - that is a consequence of an interstitial chromosomal deletion. The acquisition of a T674I resistance mutation at the time of relapse demonstrates that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is the target of imatinib. Our data indicate that the deletion of genetic material may result in gain-of-function fusion proteins.	Cools J. et al.,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003

To identify novel imatinib-sensitive lesions, we screened 11 BCR-ABL-negative cell lines and identified GDM1, derived from a patient with an atypical MPN (aMPN), as being responsive to imatinib. Screening of genes encoding known imatinib targets revealed an exon 12 mutation in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; c-FMS) with a predicted Y571D amino-acid substitution. CSF1R in GDM1 was constitutively phosphorylated, but rapidly dephosphorylated on exposure to imatinib. Y571D did not transform FDCP1 cells to growth factor independence, but resulted in a significantly increased colony growth compared with controls, constitutive CSF1R phosphorylation and elevated CSF1R signaling. We found that GDM1 expresses CSF1, and CSF1 neutralization partially inhibited proliferation, suggesting the importance of both autocrine and intrinsic mechanisms of CSF1R activation. An extensive screen of CSF1R in aMPNs and acute myeloid leukemia identified three additional novel missense variants.

Structural and copy number aberrations were found to be retained with high fidelity. However, at the single-nucleotide level, variable numbers of PDX-specific somatic events were documented, although they were only rarely functionally significant. Variant allele frequencies were often preserved in the PDXs, demonstrating that clonal representation can be transplantable. Estrogen-receptor-positive PDXs were associated with ESR1 ligand-binding-domain mutations, gene amplification, or an ESR1/YAP1 translocation. These events produced different endocrine-therapy-response phenotypes in human, cell line, and PDX endocrine-response studies. Hence, deeply sequenced PDX models are an important resource for the search for genome-forward treatment options and capture endocrine-drug-resistance etiologies that are not observed in standard cell lines. The originating tumor genome provides a benchmark for assessing genetic drift and clonal representation after transplantation. ;;Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit. ,,Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, and over two-thirds of cases express estrogen receptor-α (ER-α, encoded by ESR1). Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, we enrolled 11 patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-exome and transcriptome analysis showed that six cases harbored mutations of ESR1 affecting its ligand-binding domain (LBD), all of whom had been treated with anti-estrogens and estrogen deprivation therapies. A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified four endometrial cancers with similar mutations of ESR1. The five new LBD-localized ESR1 mutations identified here (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Cys, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly) were shown to result in constitutive activity and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that activating mutations in ESR1 are a key mechanism in acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy. ,,We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of estrogen receptor (ER) α (ESR1) mutations throughout the natural history of hormone-dependent breast cancer and to delineate the functional roles of the most commonly detected alterations. We studied a total of 249 tumor specimens from 208 patients. The specimens include 134 ER-positive (ER(+)/HER2(-)) and, as controls, 115 ER-negative (ER(-)) tumors. The ER(+) samples consist of 58 primary breast cancers and 76 metastatic samples. All tumors were sequenced to high unique coverage using next-generation sequencing targeting the coding sequence of the estrogen receptor and an additional 182 cancer-related genes. Recurring somatic mutations in codons 537 and 538 within the ligand-binding domain of ER were detected in ER(+) metastatic disease. Overall, the frequency of these mutations was 12% [9/76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6%-21%] in metastatic tumors and in a subgroup of patients who received an average of 7 lines of treatment the frequency was 20% (5/25; 95% CI, 7%-41%). These mutations were not detected in primary or treatment-naïve ER(+) cancer or in any stage of ER(-) disease. Functional studies in cell line models demonstrate that these mutations render estrogen receptor constitutive activity and confer partial resistance to currently available endocrine treatments. In this study, we show evidence for the temporal selection of functional ESR1 mutations as potential drivers of endocrine resistance during the progression of ER(+) breast cancer.;;ESR1 mutations are selected by prior aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in advanced breast cancer. We assessed the impact of ESR1 mutations on sensitivity to standard therapies in two phase III randomized trials that represent the development of the current standard therapy for estrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. In a prospective-retrospective analysis, we assessed ESR1 mutations in available archived baseline plasma from the SoFEA (Study of Faslodex Versus Exemestane With or Without Arimidex) trial, which compared exemestane with fulvestrant-containing regimens in patients with prior sensitivity to nonsteroidal AI and in baseline plasma from the PALOMA3 (Palbociclib Combined With Fulvestrant in Hormone Receptor-Positive HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer After Endocrine Failure) trial, which compared fulvestrant plus placebo with fulvestrant plus palbociclib in patients with progression after receiving prior endocrine therapy. ESR1 mutations were analyzed by multiplex digital polymerase chain reaction. In SoFEA, ESR1 mutations were found in 39.1% of patients (63 of 161), of whom 49.1% (27 of 55) were polyclonal, with rates of mutation detection unaffected by delays in processing of archival plasma. Patients with ESR1 mutations had improved progression-free survival (PFS) after taking fulvestrant (n = 45) compared with exemestane (n = 18; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.92; P = .02), whereas patients with wild-type ESR1 had similar PFS after receiving either treatment (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.67; P = .77). In PALOMA3, ESR1 mutations were found in the plasma of 25.3% of patients (91 of 360), of whom 28.6% (26 of 91) were polyclonal, with mutations associated with acquired resistance to prior AI. Fulvestrant plus palbociclib improved PFS compared with fulvestrant plus placebo in both ESR1 mutant (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.74; P = .002) and ESR1 wild-type patients (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.70; P < .001).

In lung SCC, one of the most frequently altered receptor tyrosine kinase families is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, with amplification or mutation observed in all four family members. Here, we describe the oncogenic nature of mutations observed in FGFR2 and FGFR3, each of which are observed in 3% of samples, for a mutation rate of 6% across both genes. Using cell culture and xenograft models, we show that several of these mutations drive cellular transformation. Transformation can be reversed by small-molecule FGFR inhibitors currently being developed for clinical use. We also show that mutations in the extracellular domains of FGFR2 lead to constitutive FGFR dimerization. In addition, we report a patient with an FGFR2-mutated oral SCC who responded to the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. These findings provide new insights into driving oncogenic events in a subset of lung squamous cancers, and recommend future clinical studies with FGFR inhibitors in patients with lung and head and neck SCC.,,Somatic mutations in FGFR2 are present in 4% to 5% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Amplification and mutations in FGFR genes have been identified in patients with NSCLCs, and clinical trials are testing the efficacy of anti-FGFR therapies. FGFR2 and other FGFR kinase family gene alterations have been found in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, although mouse models of FGFR-driven lung cancers have not been reported. Here, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of NSCLC driven by a kinase domain mutation in FGFR2. Combined with p53 ablation, primary grade 3/4 adenocarcinoma was induced in the lung epithelial compartment exhibiting locally invasive and pleiotropic tendencies largely made up of multinucleated cells. Tumors were acutely sensitive to pan-FGFR inhibition. This is the first FGFR2-driven lung cancer GEMM, which can be applied across different cancer indications in a preclinical setting.

To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.	,,,,Maguire SL. et al.,J. Pathol.,2015

Unfortunately, patients eventually develop resistance to these agents. We describe an acquired EGFR ectodomain mutation (S492R) that prevents cetuximab binding and confers resistance to cetuximab. Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab. Two of ten subjects studied here with disease progression after cetuximab treatment acquired this mutation. A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.,,Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibodies represents a clinical challenge in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors such as metastatic colorectal cancer, but its molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. We scanned KRAS exon 2/3/4, NRAS exon 2/3/4 and the overlapping epitopes of the EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for mutations in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue of 21 patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated with chemotherapy +/- EGFR antibodies by next-generation sequencing (\"tumor tissue\" cohort). We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring EGFR-targeted therapies. ,,Patients with colorectal cancer who respond to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab often develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. To design new lines of treatment, the molecular landscape of resistant tumors must be ascertained. We investigated the role of mutations in the EGFR signaling axis on the acquisition of resistance to cetuximab in patients and cellular models. Tissue samples were obtained from 37 patients with colorectal cancer who became refractory to cetuximab. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance. The genetic profile of tumor specimens obtained after cetuximab treatment revealed the emergence of a complex pattern of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes, including two novel EGFR ectodomain mutations (R451C and K467T). Mutational profiling of cetuximab-resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR alleles: S464L, G465R, and I491M. Structurally, these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for the R451C mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab. Colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signaling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding. Both mechanisms of resistance may occur concomitantly. Our data have implications for designing additional lines of therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who relapse upon treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies.,,Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--cetuximab and panitumumab--are widely used to treat colorectal cancer.

A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.,,Approved anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab provide significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy.

Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab.

We scanned KRAS exon 2/3/4, NRAS exon 2/3/4 and the overlapping epitopes of the EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for mutations in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue of 21 patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated with chemotherapy +/- EGFR antibodies by next-generation sequencing (\"tumor tissue\" cohort). We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring EGFR-targeted therapies. ,,Patients with colorectal cancer who respond to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab often develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy.

Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to cetuximab were treated until resistant derivatives emerged. Mutational profiling of biopsies and cell lines was performed. Structural modeling and functional analyses were performed to causally associate the alleles to resistance.

However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy.

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST. GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome. Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P =.0006) and 0.0% (P <.0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation. Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.,,Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.;;Activating mutations of the activation loop of KIT are associated with certain human neoplasms, including the majority of patients with systemic mast cell disorders, as well as cases of seminoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.;;Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets.

However, virtually all patients recur, leading to a fatal outcome. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeted therapy has been the focus of attention in novel treatment options for these patients. Here, we compared the efficacy of imatinib, sunitinib, and cediranib in glioblastoma models. In the present work, the biologic effect of the drugs was screened by viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro assays or in vivo by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Intracellular signaling was assessed by Western blot and the RTK targets were identified using phospho-RTK arrays. The amplified status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 genes was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In a panel of 10 glioblastoma cell lines, we showed that cediranib was the most potent. In addition, cediranib and sunitinib synergistically sensitize the cells to temozolomide. Cediranib efficacy was shown to associate with higher cytostatic and unique cytotoxic effects in vitro and both antitumoral and antiangiogenic activity in vivo, which could associate with its great capacity to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways. The molecular status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 did not predict glioblastoma cell responsiveness to any of the RTK inhibitors. Importantly, phospho-RTK arrays revealed novel targets for cediranib and sunitinib therapy. In conclusion, the novel targets found may be of value as future biomarkers for therapy response in glioblastoma and lead to the rational selection of patients for effective molecular targeted treatment.;;Patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are frequently treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as sunitinib. It inhibits angiogenic pathways by mainly targeting the receptors of VEGF and PDGF. In ccRCC, angiogenesis is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) which in turn leads to the induction of HIF1α target genes such as CA9 and VEGF. Furthermore, the angiogenic phenotype of ccRCC is also reflected by endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) or other tumor-promoting factors like Ki67 or survivin. Tissue microarrays from primary tumor specimens of 42 patients with metastatic ccRCC under sunitinib therapy were immunohistochemically stained for selected markers related to angiogenesis. The prognostic and predictive potential of theses markers was assessed on the basis of the objective response rate which was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria after 3, 6, 9 months and after last report (12-54 months) of sunitinib treatment. Additionally, VHL copy number and mutation analyses were performed on DNA from cryo-preserved tumor tissues of 20 ccRCC patients. Immunostaining of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β was significantly associated with the sunitinib response after 6 and 9 months as well as last report under therapy. Furthermore, HIF-1α, CA9, CD34, VEGFR1 and -3 and PDGRFα showed significant associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses high CA9 membrane staining and a response after 9 months were independent prognostic factors for longer OS. Frequently observed copy number loss and mutation of VHL gene lead to altered expression of VHL, HIF-1α, CA9, and VEGF. Immunoexpression of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β in the primary tumors of metastatic ccRCC patients might support the prediction of a good response to sunitinib treatment.	;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Heinrich MC. et al.,J.

Five of these genes failed to score in transformation assays; however, novel recurring extracellular domain mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ERBB2 were potently oncogenic. These ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants were activated by two distinct mechanisms, characterized by elevated C-terminal tail phosphorylation or by covalent dimerization mediated by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These distinct mechanisms of receptor activation converged upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, impacting cell motility. Survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants was abrogated by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, raising the possibility that patients harboring such mutations could benefit from ERBB2-directed therapy.

Deregulation of cell cycle kinases, e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can initiate a hyper-proliferative cell phenotype and cause genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation. Pharmacological agents targeting CDKs have been developed as potential anti-cancer agents for over 20 years, evolving from early pan-CDK inhibitors to second-generation inhibitors with much greater specificity and selectivity. Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful preclinical investigations, CDK inhibitors have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical trials. In addition, inhibitors of other cell cycle kinases are currently progressing through clinical trials. Recent biochemical and genetic studies might be used to improve the effectiveness of cell cycle kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer agents through better drug design, therapeutic combinations, and patient selection.

In order to identify biomarkers of response, we analyzed the in vitro activity of bendamustine and the gene expression profile in primary CLL cells. We observed that mRNA expression of CD69 (CD69) and ITGAM (CD11b) constitute the most powerful predictor of response to bendamustine. When we interrogated the predictive value of the corresponding cell surface proteins, the expression of the activation marker CD69 was the most reliable predictor of sensitivity to bendamustine. Importantly, a multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive value of CD69 expression was independent from other clinico-biological CLL features. We also showed that when CLL cells were co-cultured with distinct subtypes of stromal cells, an upregulation of CD69 was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity to bendamustine. In agreement with this, tumor cells derived from lymphoid tumor niches harbored higher CD69 expression and were less sensitive to bendamustine than their peripheral blood counterparts. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD69 high CLL cases with the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib decreased CD69 levels and enhanced bendamustine cytotoxic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that CD69 could be a predictor of bendamustine response in CLL patients and the combination of clinically-tested BCR signaling inhibitors with bendamustine may represent a promising strategy for bendamustine low responsive CLL cases.

Exploring the mechanisms of this incomplete sensitivity to devise more efficacious treatments will likely improve patients' outcomes. We tested therapies tailored around hypothesis-generating molecular features in patient-derived xenografts (\"xenopatients\"), which originated from 125 independent samples that did not harbor established resistance-conferring mutations. Samples from xenopatients that responded to cetuximab, an anti-EGFR agent, with disease stabilization displayed high levels of EGFR family ligands and receptors, indicating high EGFR pathway activity. Five of 21 SD models (23.8%) characterized by particularly high expression of EGFR and EGFR family members regressed after intensified EGFR blockade by cetuximab and a small-molecule inhibitor. In addition, a subset of cases in which enhanced EGFR inhibition was unproductive (6 of 16, 37.5%) exhibited marked overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Enrichment of IGF2 overexpressors among cases with SD was demonstrated in the entire xenopatient collection and was confirmed in patients by mining clinical gene expression data sets. In functional studies, IGF2 overproduction attenuated the efficacy of cetuximab. Conversely, interception of IGF2-dependent signaling in IGF2-overexpressing xenopatients potentiated the effects of cetuximab. The clinical implementation of IGF inhibitors awaits reliable predictors of response, but the results of this study suggest rational combination therapies for colorectal cancer and provide evidence for IGF2 as a biomarker of reduced tumor sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy and a determinant of response to combined IGF2/EGFR targeting."

To investigate the role of p21-activated kinases (PAKs) in melanoma, we determined PAK1 genomic copy number and protein expression for a panel of human melanoma tissues. PAK1 was inhibited in vitro and in vivo using RNA interference or PF-3758309 inhibitor treatment in a panel of melanoma cell lines with known BRAF and RAS (rat sarcoma) genotype to better understand its role in melanoma cell proliferation and migration. Tumorigenesis was assessed in vivo in female NCR nude mice and analyzed with cubic spline regression and area under the curve analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. Strong cytoplasmic PAK1 protein expression was prevalent in melanomas (27%) and negatively associated with activating mutation of the BRAF oncogene (P < .001). Focal copy number gain of PAK1 at 11q13 was also observed in 9% of melanomas (n = 87; copy number ≥ 2.5) and was mutually exclusive with BRAF mutation (P < .005). Selective PAK1 inhibition attenuated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well as cytoskeleton-regulating pathways to modulate the proliferation and migration of BRAF wild-type melanoma cells. Treatment of BRAF wild-type melanomas with PF-3758309 PAK inhibitor decreased tumor growth for SK-MEL23 and 537MEL xenografts (91% and 63% inhibition, respectively; P < .001) and MAPK pathway activation in vivo. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a functional role of PAK1 in BRAF wild-type melanoma and therapeutic use of PAK inhibitors in this indication.	Ong CC. et al.,J. Natl.

Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors.	Morris EJ. et al.,Cancer Discov,2013

Further validation of the prevalence of JAK3 mutations was determined by Sanger sequencing and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis in an additional 61 cases. In total, 23 of 65 (35.4%) cases harbored JAK3 mutations. Functional characterization of the JAK3 mutations support its involvement in cytokine-independent JAK/STAT constitutive activation leading to increased cell growth. Moreover, treatment of both JAK3-mutant and wild-type NKTCL cell lines with a novel pan-JAK inhibitor, CP-690550, resulted in dose-dependent reduction of phosphorylated STAT5, reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis. Hence, targeting the deregulated JAK/STAT pathway could be a promising therapy for patients with NKTCLs. Gene mutations causing NKTCL have not been fully identified. Through exome sequencing, we identified activating mutations of JAK3 that may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of NKTCLs. Our findings have important implications for the management of patients with NKTCLs.	Koo GC. et al.,Cancer Discov,2012

To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.	,,,,Maguire SL. et al.,J. Pathol.,2015

Hormonal manipulation leads to response in some patients with EC, but resistance derived from PI3K pathway activation has been documented. Targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may overcome endocrine resistance. We conducted a two-institution phase II trial of everolimus and letrozole in women with recurrent EC. Patients were considered incurable, had measurable disease, and were treated with up to two prior cytotoxic regimens. Everolimus was administered orally at 10 mg daily and letrozole was administered orally at 2.5 mg daily. Each cycle consisted of 4 weeks of therapy. Patients were treated until progression, toxicity, or complete response (CR). The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR), which was defined as CR, partial response, or stable disease (≥ 16 weeks) by RECIST 1.0 criteria. Translational studies were performed to correlate biomarkers with response. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (median age, 62 years; range, 24 to 82 years). Thirty-five patients were evaluable for response. The CBR was 40% (14 of 35 patients); the median number of cycles among responders was 15 (range, seven to 29 cycles). The confirmed objective response rate (RR) was 32% (11 of 35 patients; nine CRs and two partial responses; median, 15 cycles; range, eight to 29 cycles). Twenty percent of patients (seven of 35 patients) were taken off treatment after a prolonged CR and at the discretion of the treating clinician. None of the patients discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity. Serous histology was the best predictor of lack of response. Patients with endometrioid histology and CTNNB1 mutations responded well to everolimus and letrozole. Everolimus plus letrozole results in a high CBR and RR in patients with recurrent EC. Further development of this combination in recurrent endometrioid EC is under way.	Slomovitz BM. et al.,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.	Zou HY. et al.,Cancer Res.,2007

From an IMA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%) with KRAS mutations and 34 cases without (38%), we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutations. We used the sequencing data to identify gene fusions, and then performed functional analyses of the fusion gene products. We identified oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET. NRG1 fusions were present in 17.6% (6/34) of KRAS-negative IMAs. The CD74-NRG1 fusion activated HER2:HER3 signaling, whereas the EZR-ERBB4 and TRIM24-BRAF fusions constitutively activated the ERBB4 and BRAF kinases, respectively. Signaling pathway activation and fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth/tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells expressing these fusions were suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for clinical use. Oncogenic fusions act as driver mutations in IMAs without KRAS mutations, and thus represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of such IMAs.	Nakaoku T. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014

is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;KIT exon 8 mutations are located in the extracellular portion of the receptor and are strongly associated with core-binding factor (CBF)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To characterize the functional role of these mutants, we analyzed the proproliferative and antiapoptotic potential of 3 KIT exon 8 mutations in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells. All KIT exon 8 mutants induced receptor hyperactivation in response to stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation in terms of proliferation and resistance toward apoptotic cell death. A representative KIT exon 8 mutant showed spontaneous receptor dimerization, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and conferred IL-3-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells. MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activation was essential for the phenotype of this mutant. Additionally, imatinib inhibited proliferation of KIT exon 8 mutant-expressing Ba/F3 cells. Our data show that KIT exon 8 mutations represent gain-of-function mutations and might represent a new molecular target for treatment of CBF leukemias.;;Activating mutations of the activation loop of KIT are associated with certain human neoplasms, including the majority of patients with systemic mast cell disorders, as well as cases of seminoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.;;,,Some melanomas arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites harbor activating mutations and amplification of the type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. We explored the effects of KIT inhibition using imatinib mesylate in this molecular subset of disease. To assess clinical effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations. A single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial at 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States of 295 patients with melanoma screened for the presence of KIT mutations and amplification between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010. A total of 51 cases with such alterations were identified and 28 of these patients were treated who had advanced unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites. Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. Radiographic response, with secondary end points including time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response. Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-30%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6-18 weeks; 95% CI, 11-18 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P = .05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele. Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470470.,,Melanomas harbor aberrations in the c-Kit gene. We tested the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in selected patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutations or amplifications. Forty-three patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit aberrations were enrolled on this phase II trial. Each patient received a continuous dose of imatinib 400 mg/d unless intolerable toxicities or disease progression occurred. Fifteen patients who experienced progression of disease were allowed to escalate the dose to 800 mg/d. Forty-three patients were eligible for evaluation, and the median follow-up time was 12.0 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 36.6%. Rate of total disease control was 53.5%: 10 patients (23.3%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 36.4%) and 13 patients (30.2%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 44.4%) achieved partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), respectively. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated regression of tumor mass. Notably, nine of the 10 PRs were observed in patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51.0%. The median PFS and OS times for patients who had PR or SD versus disease progression were 9.0 months versus 1.5 months (P < .001) and 15.0 months versus 9.0 months (P = .036), respectively. Imatinib 400 mg/d was well tolerated, and only one of the 15 patients who received dose escalation to 800 mg/d achieved SD. Imatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 23.3%. Escalation to 800 mg/d could not restore disease control.,,Recent studies have shown activating KIT mutations in melanoma originating from mucosa, acral, or cumulative sun-damaged skin sites. We aimed to assess the predictive role of KIT mutation, amplification, or overexpression for response to treatment with the kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Tumor tissues from 90 patients with stage III or IV acral, mucosal, or cumulative sun-damaged skin melanoma underwent sequencing of KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ genes, FISH analysis for KIT amplification, and immunohistochemistry of KIT protein (CD117). Patients with mutations, amplifications, or overexpression of KIT were treated with sunitinib and responses measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Eleven percent of the melanomas tested had mutations in KIT, 23% in BRAF, 14% in NRAS, and none in GNAQ. Of 12 patients treated with sunitinib, 10 were evaluable. Of the 4 evaluable patients with KIT mutations, 1 had a complete remission for 15 months and 2 had partial responses (1- and 7-month duration). In contrast, only 1 of the 6 patients with only KIT amplification or overexpression alone had a partial response. In 1 responder with rectal melanoma who later progressed, the recurring tumor had a previously undetected mutation in NRAS, which was found in addition to the persisting mutation in KIT. Interestingly, among patients with manifest stage IV disease, KIT mutations were associated with a significantly shortened survival time (P < 0.0001). Sunitinib may have activity in patients with melanoma and KIT mutations; more study is needed. KIT mutations may represent an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma.;;,,Some melanomas arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites harbor activating mutations and amplification of the type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase KIT.

Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-30%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6-18 weeks; 95% CI, 11-18 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P = .05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele. Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470470.,,Melanomas harbor aberrations in the c-Kit gene. We tested the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in selected patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutations or amplifications. Forty-three patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit aberrations were enrolled on this phase II trial. Each patient received a continuous dose of imatinib 400 mg/d unless intolerable toxicities or disease progression occurred. Fifteen patients who experienced progression of disease were allowed to escalate the dose to 800 mg/d. Forty-three patients were eligible for evaluation, and the median follow-up time was 12.0 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 36.6%. Rate of total disease control was 53.5%: 10 patients (23.3%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 36.4%) and 13 patients (30.2%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 44.4%) achieved partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), respectively. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated regression of tumor mass. Notably, nine of the 10 PRs were observed in patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51.0%. The median PFS and OS times for patients who had PR or SD versus disease progression were 9.0 months versus 1.5 months (P < .001) and 15.0 months versus 9.0 months (P = .036), respectively. Imatinib 400 mg/d was well tolerated, and only one of the 15 patients who received dose escalation to 800 mg/d achieved SD. Imatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 23.3%. Escalation to 800 mg/d could not restore disease control.,,Recent studies have shown activating KIT mutations in melanoma originating from mucosa, acral, or cumulative sun-damaged skin sites. We aimed to assess the predictive role of KIT mutation, amplification, or overexpression for response to treatment with the kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Tumor tissues from 90 patients with stage III or IV acral, mucosal, or cumulative sun-damaged skin melanoma underwent sequencing of KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ genes, FISH analysis for KIT amplification, and immunohistochemistry of KIT protein (CD117). Patients with mutations, amplifications, or overexpression of KIT were treated with sunitinib and responses measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Eleven percent of the melanomas tested had mutations in KIT, 23% in BRAF, 14% in NRAS, and none in GNAQ. Of 12 patients treated with sunitinib, 10 were evaluable. Of the 4 evaluable patients with KIT mutations, 1 had a complete remission for 15 months and 2 had partial responses (1- and 7-month duration). In contrast, only 1 of the 6 patients with only KIT amplification or overexpression alone had a partial response. In 1 responder with rectal melanoma who later progressed, the recurring tumor had a previously undetected mutation in NRAS, which was found in addition to the persisting mutation in KIT. Interestingly, among patients with manifest stage IV disease, KIT mutations were associated with a significantly shortened survival time (P < 0.0001). Sunitinib may have activity in patients with melanoma and KIT mutations; more study is needed. KIT mutations may represent an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma.;;A 79-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with a 2-month history of pruritus ani and a pigmented nodular lesion was discovered in the posterior rectum. The patient had no other symptoms, or any family history of malignancy. Physical examination; excisional biopsy; CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis; lung biopsy; blood tests; tumor immunohistochemistry for KIT, vascular endothelial growth factor platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta, and mismatch-repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6; and KIT and BRAF tumor genotyping. Stage IV M1b metastatic anal mucosal melanoma. Wide local excision with mucosal advancement of the rectal wall, external-beam radiation, and sorafenib-temozolomide therapy.,,Mutations in KIT are more frequent in specific melanoma subtypes, and response to KIT inhibition is likely to depend on the identified mutation. A total of 32 patients with metastatic acral or mucosal melanoma were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13 and 17. KIT mutations were found in 38% of mucosal and in 6% of acral melanomas. Three patients were treated with imatinib and one with sorafenib. All four patients responded to treatment, but three have since progressed within the brain. The observed clinical responses support further investigation of KIT inhibitors in metastatic melanoma, selected according to KIT mutation status.;;Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.;;Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets.

The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.,,Imatinib mesylate is standard treatment for patients who have advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but not all patients benefit equally. In previous studies, GIST genotype correlated with treatment outcome and optimal imatinib dosing. We examined the relationship between kinase genotype and treatment outcome for 428 patients enrolled on the North American phase III study SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 and treated with either 400 mg or 800 mg daily doses of imatinib. The presence of KIT exon 11-mutant genotype (n = 283) correlated with improved treatment outcome when compared with KIT exon 9-mutant (n = 32) and wild-type (WT; n = 67) genotypes for objective response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR], 71.7% v 44.4% [P = .007]; and 44.6% [P = .0002], respectively); time to tumor progression (TTP; median 24.7 months v 16.7 and 12.8 months, respectively); and overall survival (OS; median 60.0 months v 38.4 and 49.0 months, respectively). The survival outcomes for patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or WT GIST were not affected by imatinib dose. However, there was evidence of improved response rates for patients with exon 9-mutant tumors treated with imatinib 800 mg versus 400 mg (CR/PR, 67% v 17%; P = .02). Patients who had CD117-negative GIST had similar TTP but inferior OS compared with patients who had CD117-positive disease, which suggests that patients who have CD117-negative GIST may benefit from imatinib treatment. In addition, we identified novel but rare mutations of the KIT extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9). We confirmed the favorable impact of KIT exon 11 genotype when compared with KIT exon 9 and wild-type genotype for patients with advanced GIST who are treated with imatinib.,,A recent randomized EORTC phase III trial, comparing two doses of imatinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), reported dose dependency for progression-free survival. The current analysis of that study aimed to assess if tumour mutational status correlates with clinical response to imatinib. Pre-treatment samples of GISTs from 377 patients enrolled in phase III study were analyzed for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA by combination of D-HPLC and direct sequencing of tumour genomic DNA. Mutation types were correlated with patients' survival data. The presence of exon 9-activating mutations in KIT was the strongest adverse prognostic factor for response to imatinib, increasing the relative risk of progression by 171% (P<0.0001) and the relative risk of death by 190% (P<0.0001) when compared with KIT exon 11 mutants. Similarly, the relative risk of progression was increased by 108% (P<0.0001) and the relative risk of death by 76% (P=0.028) in patients without detectable KIT or PDGFRA mutations. In patients whose tumours expressed an exon 9 KIT oncoprotein, treatment with the high-dose regimen resulted in a significantly superior progression-free survival (P=0.0013), with a reduction of the relative risk of 61%. We conclude that tumour genotype is of major prognostic significance for progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with imatinib for advanced GISTs. Our findings suggest the need for differential treatment of patients with GISTs, with KIT exon 9 mutant patients benefiting the most from the 800 mg daily dose of the drug.;;Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.;;Advanced thymic carcinoma (TC) is a very aggressive disease. To date there are no established treatment options for the refractory and recurrent disease and only a few prospective trials have been conducted in patients with TC. Here we present a case of a relapsed TC patient, who, by using combination chemotherapy, showed a positive response to sorafenib with C-KIT exon 11 mutation.;;Melanomas harbor aberrations in the c-Kit gene. We tested the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in selected patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutations or amplifications. Forty-three patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit aberrations were enrolled on this phase II trial. Each patient received a continuous dose of imatinib 400 mg/d unless intolerable toxicities or disease progression occurred. Fifteen patients who experienced progression of disease were allowed to escalate the dose to 800 mg/d. Forty-three patients were eligible for evaluation, and the median follow-up time was 12.0 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 36.6%. Rate of total disease control was 53.5%: 10 patients (23.3%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 36.4%) and 13 patients (30.2%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 44.4%) achieved partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), respectively. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated regression of tumor mass. Notably, nine of the 10 PRs were observed in patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51.0%. The median PFS and OS times for patients who had PR or SD versus disease progression were 9.0 months versus 1.5 months (P < .001) and 15.0 months versus 9.0 months (P = .036), respectively. Imatinib 400 mg/d was well tolerated, and only one of the 15 patients who received dose escalation to 800 mg/d achieved SD. Imatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 23.3%. Escalation to 800 mg/d could not restore disease control.,,Some melanomas arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites harbor activating mutations and amplification of the type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. We explored the effects of KIT inhibition using imatinib mesylate in this molecular subset of disease. To assess clinical effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations. A single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial at 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States of 295 patients with melanoma screened for the presence of KIT mutations and amplification between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010. A total of 51 cases with such alterations were identified and 28 of these patients were treated who had advanced unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites. Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. Radiographic response, with secondary end points including time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response. Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-30%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6-18 weeks; 95% CI, 11-18 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P = .05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele. Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470470.;;KIT activity is crucial for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib (IMA) and sunitinib (SUN) are very effective KIT-inhibitors in patients with advanced GIST but have no curative potential. We evaluated the efficacy of the novel HSP90 inhibitor IPI-493 alone, or in combination with IMA or SUN in GIST xenografts with KIT mutations. Nude mice (n = 98) were grafted bilaterally with human GIST carrying KIT exon 11 (GIST-PSW), KIT exon 9 (GIST-BOE), or double, KIT imatinib-sensitive exon 11 and imatinib-resistant exon 17 mutations (GIST-48). Mice were divided into six treatment groups and dosed orally for 15 days as follows: (i) control group, sterile water; (ii) IMA alone; (iii) SUN alone; (iv) IPI-493 alone; (v) IPI-493+IMA; and (vi) IPI-493+SUN. Treatment with IPI-493 resulted in tumor growth stabilization, variable proliferation arrest, induction of apoptosis and necrosis, and downregulation of KIT and its signaling cascade, especially in the GIST-BOE model. Significant reduction of vessel density was observed with IPI-493 treatment, and was equal to SUN treatment in GIST-PSW and GIST-BOE xenografts. IPI-493 treatment effects were enhanced in combination with TKIs, especially with IPI-493+SUN. In our hands, IPI-493 showed dose-dependent liver damages. When administered as a single agent in a xenograft model, the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-493 has consistent antitumor activity and induces KIT downregulation in GISTs with heterogeneous KIT mutations. IPI-493 synergizes with TKIs that are commonly used for the treatment of advanced or IMA-resistant GIST. The antitumor response of IPI-493 is particularly enhanced in combination with SUN.;;Patients with metastatic melanoma have a poor prognosis and few treatment options are available. We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications. This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events. We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies. Currently, phase II nilotinib trial is ongoing in Korea as multi-center study.,,Although durable responses can be achieved with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib in melanomas harboring KIT mutations, the efficacy of alternative inhibitors after progression to imatinib and the activity of these agents on brain metastases are unknown. We conducted a phase II study of nilotinib 400 mg twice a day in two cohorts of patients with melanomas harboring KIT mutations or amplification: (A) those refractory or intolerant to a prior KIT inhibitor; and (B) those with brain metastases. The primary endpoint was 4-month disease control rate. Secondary endpoints included response rate, time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). A Simon two-stage and a single-stage design was planned to assess for the primary endpoint in cohorts A and B, respectively. Twenty patients were enrolled and 19 treated (11 in cohort A; 8 in cohort B). Three patients on cohort A [27%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 8%-56%] and 1 on cohort B (12.5%; 90% CI, 0.6%-47%) achieved the primary endpoint. Two partial responses were observed in cohort A (18.2%; 90% CI, 3%-47%); none were observed in cohort B. The median TTP and OS was 3.3 (90% CI, 2.1-3.9 months) and 9.1 months (90% CI, 4.3-14.2 months), respectively, in all treated patients. Nilotinib may achieve disease control in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations and whose disease progressed after imatinib therapy. The efficacy of this agent in KIT-altered melanoma with brain metastasis is limited.;;Patients with advanced GIST following standard imatinib and sunitinib often have good performance status and need additional therapy. This study tested nilotinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced GIST refractory to standard therapies. This single-center open-label phase II study has a primary objective to determine progression-free survival at 6 months. Using a novel statistical design, 17 patients were to be enrolled; if ≥ 10 were progression free (PF) at 2 months, 19 additional patients would be enrolled. The therapy was considered of benefit if ≥ 13 of 36 patients were PF at 6 months. All patients signed informed consent and entry criteria included normal cardiac function. Exploratory analyses correlating genotype with response were also performed. Thirteen patients were treated; 2 had received agents after imatinib and sunitinib. Treatment was well tolerated with one grade 4 anemia attributed to nilotinib. No measurable responses were observed; median time to progression was 2 months. One patient remained on study with stable disease for 12 months. Mutation testing is available from 10 primary tumors with 7 exon 11 mutations, 1 exon 9 mutation, and 2 without KIT/PDGFR mutations. Two samples from recurrent disease had 2 mutations, both primary exon 11 mutations with an additional exon 17 mutation, including the patient with prolonged stable disease. Nilotinib was well tolerated in these patients with advanced GIST. Accrual was halted due to insufficient clinical benefit. However, nilotinib may provide benefit to specific subsets of advanced GIST with exon 17 mutations.,,Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) resistant to both imatinib and sunitinib have a poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. In this study, the efficacy and safety of nilotinib (AMN107) as a third-line therapy for patients with GISTs was evaluated. A single-arm, open-label trial was conducted in 8 Japanese hospitals. The key eligibility criteria included resistance or intolerance to both imatinib and sunitinib treatment. The primary endpoint was disease control rate, defined as the percentage of patients with complete response, partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) lasting 24 weeks or longer. Thirty-five patients were enrolled and treated with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, which generally was well tolerated. Disease control rate at Week 24 was 29% (90% confidence interval, 16.4%-43.6%). The median progression-free survival was 113 days, and the median overall survival was 310 days. The objective response rate was 3%, comprising 1 PR in a patient with a GIST possessing both a KIT exon 11 mutation, and an imatinib-resistant and sunitinib-resistant KIT exon 17 mutation. Twenty-three (66%) patients had SD (≥6 weeks) as the best response. These results suggest that nilotinib is generally well tolerated and has encouraging antitumor activity in patients with GIST who failed both imatinib and sunitinib.;;Recent studies have shown activating KIT mutations in melanoma originating from mucosa, acral, or cumulative sun-damaged skin sites. We aimed to assess the predictive role of KIT mutation, amplification, or overexpression for response to treatment with the kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Tumor tissues from 90 patients with stage III or IV acral, mucosal, or cumulative sun-damaged skin melanoma underwent sequencing of KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ genes, FISH analysis for KIT amplification, and immunohistochemistry of KIT protein (CD117). Patients with mutations, amplifications, or overexpression of KIT were treated with sunitinib and responses measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Eleven percent of the melanomas tested had mutations in KIT, 23% in BRAF, 14% in NRAS, and none in GNAQ. Of 12 patients treated with sunitinib, 10 were evaluable. Of the 4 evaluable patients with KIT mutations, 1 had a complete remission for 15 months and 2 had partial responses (1- and 7-month duration). In contrast, only 1 of the 6 patients with only KIT amplification or overexpression alone had a partial response. In 1 responder with rectal melanoma who later progressed, the recurring tumor had a previously undetected mutation in NRAS, which was found in addition to the persisting mutation in KIT. Interestingly, among patients with manifest stage IV disease, KIT mutations were associated with a significantly shortened survival time (P < 0.0001). Sunitinib may have activity in patients with melanoma and KIT mutations; more study is needed. KIT mutations may represent an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma.;;To evaluated the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who failed to previous standard treatments. Thirty-one patients with measurable metastatic GIST who failed both imatinib and sunitinib were accrued. Sorafenib was administered orally at 400 mg twice daily until disease progression or development of intolerance. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (response + stable disease, DCR) at 24 weeks. Sorafenib was well tolerated, with hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, hypertension, and abdominal pain being the most frequent adverse events. The relative dose intensity of sorafenib during the first 6 months was >80%. Four patients achieved partial response (response rate 13%, 95% CI 1-25%), and 16 (52%) had stable disease. DCR at 24 weeks was measured as 36% (95% CI 19-52%). Median progression-free and overall survivals were 4.9 and 9.7 months, respectively. Progression-free survival of patients with prior use of nilotinib (P = .0085) and with primary genotypes other than KIT exon 11 mutation (P = .0341) was significantly shorter than that of patients without. Sorafenib showed antitumor activity in this population of imatinib and sunitinib pretreated GIST. With sorafenib, about one third of patients can maintain disease control for more than 24 weeks.;;HSP90 inhibition leads to proteosomal degradation of activated KIT and has in vitro activity against gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). BIIB021 is an oral non-ansamycin HSP90 inhibitor. We carried out a phase II study of BIIB021 in patients with GIST refractory to imatinib and sunitinib. The primary end-point was metabolic partial response (mPR) as assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The secondary end-points were pharmacokinetic assessments of BIIB021 and pharmacodynamic assessments of HSP70. Twenty-three patients were treated on two schedules: 12 pts received 600 mg twice a week (BIW) and 11 patients received 400 mg three times a week (TIW). All had prior imatinib and sunitinib but stopped>14 days before starting BIIB021. The median age was 59 years (33-88 years), 61% male, 44% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1 (ECOG1). The best response was PR by FDG-PET for five patients (3/12 at 600 mg BIW and 2/9 at 400 TIW) for an overall response rate of 22%. The response duration was 25-138 days. Adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate. The mean Cmax was 1.5 µmol and the mean AUC was 2.9 µmol h. Cmax>1.5 µmol was associated with a decrease in standardized uptake value (SUVmax). HSP70 increased substantially following treatment. This study met its primary end-point. BIIB021 leads to objective responses in refractory GIST patients. Pharmacodynamic studies confirmed HSP90 inhibition. Further evaluation of BIIB021 in GIST is warranted.;;Activation of the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is rare in melanoma, but occurs in 20-40% of melanoma arising on mucosal membranes, acral skin and skin with chronic sun-induced damage. Many activating c-Kit mutations have been shown to be highly sensitive to imatinib mesylate, although the majority of patients with c-Kit mutant melanoma eventually progress on this inhibitor. We examined acquired resistance to imatinib and the newer generation inhibitor nilotinib in resistant c-kit mutant melanoma sublines. Four imatinib-resistant and six nilotinib-resistant sublines had acquired additional, secondary c-Kit mutations. The secondary A829P c-Kit mutation rendered cells resistant to imatinib, but did not suppress the activity of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib. Sublines with an additional T670I c-Kit mutation showed resistance to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, but responded to sunitinib. The concurrent inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was also effective at promoting apoptosis in the parent and derived resistant sublines. Our data provide a rationale for treating patients with melanoma progressing on imatinib or nilotinib with alternative RTK inhibitors or inhibitors targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling cascades. ,,We report the rare family in which cutaneous mastocytosis was diagnosed in the father and two children, with urticaria pigmentosa as the only manifestation of the disease. The diagnosis of mastocytosis in the father included bone marrow histopathological and cytological examinations and flow cytometry, and histopathological examination of the skin. In the children, tryptase measurement and skin histopathological examination were performed. Blood, urine, and buccal swab specimens were collected from the family members. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing KIT-WT and KIT-N882I. In addition, Ba/F3 cell lines expressing KIT-N822I, KIT-D816V, and KIT-V559D mutants were treated with imatinib and dasatinib. The effect of treatment on proliferation, survival, and signaling was determined. Germ-line KIT-N822I missense mutation was detected in the affected members of the family. Western blot analysis using HEK293T and Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT-N822I isoform showed that KIT-N822I constitutively activated KIT tyrosine phosphorylation. In vitro assays on KIT-N822I-expressing Ba/F3 cells confirmed that the N822I mutant is resistant to imatinib mesylate. In contrast, a high efficacy of dasatinib toward the KIT-N822I-expressing Ba/F3 cells was observed. We provided evidence that KIT p.N822I mutation has transforming potential and can cause a constitutive activation of KIT. In addition, we demonstrated that KIT-N822I is resistant to imatinib and sensitive to dasatinib. Finally, our findings support the hypothesis that not only KIT mutations but other additional genetic abnormalities are contributing to more advanced forms of the disease.,,Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) is a very rare form of mast cell neoplasm that does not benefit from conventional chemotherapy. The majority of adult mast cell neoplasms and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have mutations in the proto-oncogene c-kit, which encodes the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. The c-kit gene mutations are generally confined to the tyrosine kinase II domain in mast cell neoplasms, but are often observed at the juxtamembrane domain in GISTs. We found a case of ASM with a juxtamembrane-type mutation, Val559Ile, and in this report the mutation was characterized through transfection of the mutated c-kit cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells. Phosphorylation of KIT and its possible downstream signaling molecules were examined in the presence or absence of imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Ligand-independent autophosphorylation was observed in the mutant KIT with Val559Ile as well as that with Val559Asp, as found in GISTs. Imatinib, at a concentration of 10 microM, inhibited autophosphorylation of the mutant KIT with Val559Asp, but not that with the Val559Ile. Phosphorylation of MAPK and STAT5 was also inhibited by imatinib at the same concentration, in cells expressing Val559Asp but not in those expressing Val559Ile. These results suggest that different mutations, even at the same codon, in juxtamembrane domain of the c-kit gene show different inhibitory effects of imatinib, and that patients with GISTs or mast cell neoplasms possessing this Val559Ile mutation are resistant to imatinib therapy.;;Amplifications and mutations in the KIT proto-oncogene in subsets of melanomas provide therapeutic opportunities. We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of imatinib in metastatic mucosal, acral, or chronically sun-damaged (CSD) melanoma with KIT amplifications and/or mutations. Patients received imatinib 400 mg once per day or 400 mg twice per day if there was no initial response. Dose reductions were permitted for treatment-related toxicities. Additional oncogene mutation screening was performed by mass spectroscopy. Twenty-five patients were enrolled (24 evaluable). Eight patients (33%) had tumors with KIT mutations, 11 (46%) with KIT amplifications, and five (21%) with both. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 3.7 to 27.1 months). Best overall response rate (BORR) was 29% (21% excluding nonconfirmed responses) with a two-stage 95% CI of 13% to 51%. BORR was significantly greater than the hypothesized null of 5% and statistically significantly different by mutation status (7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only). There were no statistical differences in rates of progression or survival by mutation status or by melanoma site. The overall disease control rate was 50% but varied significantly by KIT mutation status (77% mutated v 18% amplified). Four patients harbored pretreatment NRAS mutations, and one patient acquired increased KIT amplification after treatment. Melanomas that arise on mucosal, acral, or CSD skin should be assessed for KIT mutations. Imatinib can be effective when tumors harbor KIT mutations, but not if KIT is amplified only. NRAS mutations and KIT copy number gain may be mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to imatinib.;;Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a KIT oncogene-driven tumor, on imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment may develop secondary KIT mutations to confer IM-resistant phenotype. Second-line sunitinib malate (SU) therapy is largely ineffective for IM-resistant GISTs with secondary exon 17 (activation-loop domain) mutations. We established an in vitro cell-based platform consisting of a series of COS-1 cells expressing KIT cDNA constructs encoding common primary±secondary mutations observed in GISTs, to compare the activity of several commercially available tyrosine kinase inhibitors on inhibiting the phosphorylation of mutant KIT proteins at their clinically achievable plasma steady-state concentration (Css). The inhibitory efficacies on KIT exon 11/17 mutants were further validated by growth inhibition assay on GIST48 cells, and underlying molecular-structure mechanisms were investigated by molecular modeling. Our results showed that SU more effectively inhibited mutant KIT with secondary exon 13 or 14 mutations than those with secondary exon 17 mutations, as clinically indicated. On contrary, at individual Css, nilotinib and sorafenib more profoundly inhibited the phosphorylation of KIT with secondary exon 17 mutations and the growth of GIST48 cells than IM, SU, and dasatinib. Molecular modeling analysis showed fragment deletion of exon 11 and point mutation on exon 17 would lead to a shift of KIT conformational equilibrium toward active form, for which nilotinib and sorafenib bound more stably than IM and SU. In current preclinical study, nilotinib and sorafenib are more active in IM-resistant GISTs with secondary exon 17 mutation than SU that deserve further clinical investigation. ;;Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a KIT oncogene-driven tumor, on imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment may develop secondary KIT mutations to confer IM-resistant phenotype.

Patients with well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma were enrolled at four centres in France. Patients received up to three 28-day neoadjuvant treatment cycles of RG7112 1440 mg/m(2) per day for 10 days. If a patient progressed at any point after the first cycle, the lesion was resected or, if unresectable, an end-of-study biopsy was done. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis). All analyses were per protocol. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2009-015522-10. Between June 3, and Dec 14, 2010, 20 patients were enrolled and completed pretreatment and day 8 biopsies. 18 of 20 patients had TP53 wild-type tumours and two carried missense TP53 mutations. 14 of 17 assessed patients had MDM2 gene amplification. Compared with baseline, P53 and P21 concentrations, assessed by immunohistochemistry, had increased by a median of 4·86 times (IQR 4·38-7·97; p=0·0001) and 3·48 times (2·05-4·09; p=0·0001), respectively, at day 8 (give or take 2 days). At the same timepoint, relative MDM2 mRNA expression had increased by a median of 3·03 times (1·23-4·93; p=0·003) that at baseline. The median change from baseline for Ki-67-positive tumour cells was -5·05% (IQR -12·55 to 0·05; p=0·01). Drug exposure correlated with blood concentrations of MIC-1 (p<0·0001) and haematological toxicity. One patient had a confirmed partial response and 14 had stable disease. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, mostly nausea (14 patients), vomiting (11 patients), asthenia (nine patients), diarrhoea (nine patients), and thrombocytopenia (eight patients). There were 12 serious adverse events in eight patients, the most common of which were neutropenia (six patients) and thrombocytopenia (three patients). MDM2 inhibition activates the P53 pathway and decreases cell proliferation in MDM2-amplified liposarcoma. This study suggests that it is feasible to undertake neoadjuvant biopsy-driven biomarker studies in liposarcoma. F Hoffmann-La Roche.,,;;Purpose Owing to its exquisite chemotherapy sensitivity, most patients with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are cured with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, up to 30% of patients with advanced GCT exhibit cisplatin resistance, which requires intensive salvage treatment, and have a 50% risk of cancer-related death. To identify a genetic basis for cisplatin resistance, we performed whole-exome and targeted sequencing of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Methods Men with GCT who received a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen and had available tumor tissue were eligible to participate in this study. Whole-exome sequencing or targeted exon-capture-based sequencing was performed on 180 tumors. Patients were categorized as cisplatin sensitive or cisplatin resistant by using a combination of postchemotherapy parameters, including serum tumor marker levels, radiology, and pathology at surgical resection of residual disease. Results TP53 alterations were present exclusively in cisplatin-resistant tumors and were particularly prevalent among primary mediastinal nonseminomas (72%). TP53 pathway alterations including MDM2 amplifications were more common among patients with adverse clinical features, categorized as poor risk according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) model. Despite this association, TP53 and MDM2 alterations predicted adverse prognosis independent of the IGCCCG model. Actionable alterations, including novel RAC1 mutations, were detected in 55% of cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Conclusion In GCT, TP53 and MDM2 alterations were associated with cisplatin resistance and inferior outcomes, independent of the IGCCCG model. The finding of frequent TP53 alterations among mediastinal primary nonseminomas may explain the more frequent chemoresistance observed with this tumor subtype. A substantial portion of cisplatin-resistant GCTs harbor actionable alterations, which might respond to targeted therapies. Genomic profiling of patients with advanced GCT could improve current risk stratification and identify novel therapeutic approaches for patients with cisplatin-resistant disease.

Somatic mutations of PIK3R1 are observed in multiple tumor types, but the tumorigenic activity of these mutations has not been demonstrated in GBM. We show here that somatic mutations in the iSH2 domain of PIK3R1 act as oncogenic driver events. Specifically, introduction of a subset of the mutations identified in human GBM, in the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, increases signaling through the PI3K pathway and promotes tumorigenesis of primary normal human astrocytes in an orthotopic xenograft model. Furthermore, we show that cells that are dependent on mutant P85α-mediated PI3K signaling exhibit increased sensitivity to a small molecule inhibitor of AKT. Together, these results suggest that GBM patients whose tumors carry mutant PIK3R1 alleles may benefit from treatment with inhibitors of AKT.	;;Quayle SN. et al.,PLoS ONE,2012

Laboratory studies suggested that HER2L869R is a neratinib-sensitive, gain-of-function mutation that upon dimerization with mutant HER3E928G, also present in the breast cancer, amplifies HER2 signaling. The patient was treated with neratinib and exhibited a sustained partial response. Upon clinical progression, HER2T798I was detected in plasma tumor cell-free DNA. Structural modeling of this acquired mutation suggested that the increased bulk of isoleucine in HER2T798I reduces neratinib binding. Neratinib blocked HER2-mediated signaling and growth in cells expressing HER2L869R but not HER2L869R/T798I In contrast, afatinib and the osimertinib metabolite AZ5104 strongly suppressed HER2L869R/T798I-induced signaling and cell growth. Acquisition of HER2T798I upon development of resistance to neratinib in a breast cancer with an initial activating HER2 mutation suggests HER2L869R is a driver mutation. HER2T798I-mediated neratinib resistance may be overcome by other irreversible HER2 inhibitors like afatinib.Significance: We found an acquired HER2 gatekeeper mutation in a patient with HER2-mutant breast cancer upon clinical progression on neratinib. We speculate that HER2T798I may arise as a secondary mutation following response to effective HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in other cancers with HER2-activating mutations. This resistance may be overcome by other irreversible HER2 TKIs, such as afatinib. Cancer Discov; 7(6); 575-85. ©2017 AACR.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 539.

Although responses to TRK inhibition can be dramatic and durable, duration of response may eventually be limited by acquired resistance. LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs.

Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.

Although there have been significant advances in therapy for MM including the use of proteasome inhibitors, t(4;14) MM has a particularly poor prognosis and most patients still die from complications related to their disease or therapy. One potential therapeutic strategy is to inhibit FGFR3 in those myeloma patients that overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase due to chromosomal translocation. Here we evaluated PKC412, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for treatment of FGFR3-induced hematopoietic malignancies. PKC412 inhibited kinase activation and proliferation of hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells transformed by FGFR3 TDII or a TEL-FGFR3 fusion. Similar results were obtained in PKC412 inhibition of several different t(4;14)-positive human MM cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with PKC412 resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of survival in murine bone marrow transplant models of FGFR3 TDII-induced pre-B cell lymphoma, or a peripheral T-cell lymphoma associated TEL-FGFR3 fusion-induced myeloproliferative disease. These data indicate that PKC412 may be a useful molecularly targeted therapy for MM associated with overexpression of FGFR3, and perhaps other diseases associated with dysregulation of FGFR3 or related mutants.,,The FGFR3 receptor tyrosine kinase represents an attractive target for therapy due to its role in several human disorders, including skeletal dysplasias, multiple myeloma, and cervical and bladder carcinomas. By using molecular library screening, we identified a compound named NF449 with inhibitory activity toward FGFR3 signaling. In cultured chondrocytes and murine limb organ culture, NF449 rescued FGFR3-mediated extracellular matrix loss and growth inhibition, which represent two major cellular phenotypes of aberrant FGFR3 signaling in cartilage. Similarly, NF449 antagonized FGFR3 action in the multiple myeloma cell lines OPM2 and KMS11, as evidenced by NF449-mediated reversal of ERK MAPK activation and transcript accumulation of CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines, both of which are induced by FGFR3 activation. In cell-free kinase assays, NF449 inhibited the kinase activity of both wild type and a disease-associated FGFR3 mutant (K650E) in a fashion that appeared non-competitive with ATP. Our data identify NF449 as a novel antagonist of FGFR3 signaling, useful for FGFR3 inhibition alone or in combination with inhibitors that target the ATP binding site.,,Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) can act as driving oncoproteins in certain cancers, making them attractive drug targets. Here we have characterized tumour cell responses to two new inhibitors of FGFR1-3, AZ12908010 and the clinical candidate AZD4547, making comparisons with the well-characterized FGFR inhibitor PD173074. In a panel of 16 human tumour cell lines, the anti-proliferative activity of AZ12908010 or AZD4547 was strongly linked to the presence of deregulated FGFR signalling, indicating that addiction to deregulated FGFRs provides a therapeutic opportunity for selective intervention. Acquired resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a growing problem in the clinic but has not yet been explored for FGFR inhibitors. To assess how FGFR-dependent tumour cells adapt to long-term FGFR inhibition, we generated a derivative of the KMS-11 myeloma cell line (FGFR(Y373C)) with acquired resistance to AZ12908010 (KMS-11R cells). Basal phosphorylated FGFR and FGFR-dependent downstream signalling were constitutively elevated and refractory to drug in KMS-11R cells. Sequencing of FGFR3 in KMS-11R cells revealed the presence of a heterozygous mutation at the gatekeeper residue, encoding FGFR3(V555M); consistent with this, KMS-11R cells were cross-resistant to AZD4547 and PD173074. These results define the selectivity and efficacy of two new FGFR inhibitors and identify a secondary gatekeeper mutation as a mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors that should be anticipated as clinical evaluation proceeds.;;The ectopically expressed and deregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has been observed in approximately 20% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In this study, we investigated whether the therapeutic effect of bortezomib is associated with FGFR3 expression. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed in minimal FGFR3 expressing U266 cells and compared to U266 cells overexpressing FGFR3 wild-type (T-U266), or Y373C (Y-U266) or K650E (K-U266) mutant FGFR3. Our results suggested cell survival decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, expression of FGFR3 protein was similarly dose dependent on bortezomib. It is confirmed the bortezomib-induced apoptotic death is correlated with FGFR3 expression. Furthermore, increased expression of p-STAT3, Mcl-1 and VEGF suggested that bortezomib resistance associated with Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be partly mediated through p-STAT3 signaling. Our data indicates that Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be associated with bortezomib-related treatment resistance in multiple myeloma.,,The ectopically expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and its constitutively active mutations have been detected in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). This study investigated whether the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib on malignant plasma cells are associated with FGFR3 expression and the existence of mutations of FGFR3. Cell apoptosis assays were performed in a plasmacytoma cell line, FR4 cells and a myeloma cell line, RPMI8226 cells overexpressing wild-type FGFR3 (FGFR3(WT)) or two different mutants, FGFR3(K650E) or FGFR3(Y373C), and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein was compared between each type of cell. FR4 cells with FGFR3(K650E) showed enhanced sensitivity to bortezomib together with increased induction of ER stress proteins, compared to FR4 cells with mock, FGFR3(WT) or FGFR3(Y373C). RPMI8226 cells with FGFR3(K650E) also showed enhanced bortezomib sensitivity. This study indicated that FGFR3K650E is associated with bortezomib sensitivity in malignant plasma cells via ER stress pathways.;;Targetable oncogenic alterations are detected more commonly in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who never smoked cigarettes. For such patients, specific kinase inhibitors have emerged as effective clinical treatments. However, the currently known oncogenic alterations do not account for all never smokers who develop NSCLC. We sought to identify additional oncogenic alterations from patients with NSCLC to define additional treatment options. We analyzed 576 lung adenocarcinomas from patients of Asian and Caucasian ethnicity. We identified a subset of cancers that did not harbor any known oncogenic alteration. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay on 24 patients from this set with >75% tumor cell content. EGFR mutations were the most common oncogenic alteration from both Asian (53%) and Caucasian (41.6%) patients. No known oncogenic alterations were present in 25.7% of Asian and 31% of Caucasian tumor specimens. We identified a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion event in one of 24 patients from this subset using targeted NGS. Two additional patients harboring FGFR3-TACC3 were identified by screening our entire cohort (overall prevalence, 0.5%). Expression of FGFR3-TACC3 led to IL3 independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. These cells were sensitive to pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (pan-FGFR) inhibitors but not the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib. FGFR3-TACC3 rearrangements occur in a subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Such patients should be considered for clinical trials featuring FGFR inhibitors.;;JNJ-42756493 is an orally administered pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This first-in-human study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and defines the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493. Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of JNJ-42756493 from 0.5 to 12 mg administered continuously daily or JNJ-42756493 10 or 12 mg administered intermittently (7 days on/7 days off). Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (65%), asthenia (55%), dry mouth (45%), nail toxicity (35%), constipation (34%), decreased appetite (32%), and dysgeusia (31%). Twenty-seven patients (42%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, and one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT elevation was observed at 12 mg daily. Maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Nine milligrams daily was considered as the initial RP2D; however, tolerability was improved with intermittent schedules, and 10 mg administered on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule was considered the final RP2D. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional, and predictable, with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Dose-dependent elevations in serum phosphate, a manifestation of pharmacodynamic effect, occurred in all patients starting at 4 mg daily. Among 23 response-evaluable patients with tumor FGFR pathway alterations, four confirmed responses and one unconfirmed partial response were observed in patients with glioblastoma and urothelial and endometrial cancer (all with FGFR2 or FGFR3 translocations); 16 patients had stable disease. JNJ-42756493 administered at 10 mg on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule achieved exposures at which clinical responses were observed, demonstrated pharmacodynamic biomarker activity, and had a manageable safety profile.;;JNJ-42756493 is an orally administered pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This first-in-human study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and defines the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493. Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of JNJ-42756493 from 0.5 to 12 mg administered continuously daily or JNJ-42756493 10 or 12 mg administered intermittently (7 days on/7 days off). Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (65%), asthenia (55%), dry mouth (45%), nail toxicity (35%), constipation (34%), decreased appetite (32%), and dysgeusia (31%). Twenty-seven patients (42%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, and one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT elevation was observed at 12 mg daily. Maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Nine milligrams daily was considered as the initial RP2D; however, tolerability was improved with intermittent schedules, and 10 mg administered on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule was considered the final RP2D. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional, and predictable, with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Dose-dependent elevations in serum phosphate, a manifestation of pharmacodynamic effect, occurred in all patients starting at 4 mg daily.

Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with escalating dosages of BGJ398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR1-amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82.5%), constipation (50.9%), decreased appetite (45.6%), and stomatitis (45.6%). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (RP2D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off (50.0%) versus the continuous (73.7%) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ398 at the MTD/RP2D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancers.

One potential drug target is isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which is mutated in multiple human cancers. Here, we examine the role of mutant IDH1 in fully transformed cells with endogenous IDH1 mutations. A selective R132H-IDH1 inhibitor (AGI-5198) identified through a high-throughput screen blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the ability of the mutant enzyme (mIDH1) to produce R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). Under conditions of near-complete R-2HG inhibition, the mIDH1 inhibitor induced demethylation of histone H3K9me3 and expression of genes associated with gliogenic differentiation. Blockade of mIDH1 impaired the growth of IDH1-mutant--but not IDH1-wild-type--glioma cells without appreciable changes in genome-wide DNA methylation. These data suggest that mIDH1 may promote glioma growth through mechanisms beyond its well-characterized epigenetic effects.;;;;Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 proteins alter the epigenetic landscape in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Here we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are synthetic lethal to the IDH1(R132H) mutation in AML and identified the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. IDH1- and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models. This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HG-mediated inhibition of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2 mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies. ;;Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive liver bile duct malignancy exhibiting frequent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/IDH2) mutations. Through a high-throughput drug screen of a large panel of cancer cell lines, including 17 biliary tract cancers, we found that IDH mutant (IDHm) ICC cells demonstrate a striking response to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, with the highest sensitivity among 682 solid tumor cell lines. Using unbiased proteomics to capture the activated kinome and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to introduce dasatinib-resistant \"gatekeeper\" mutant kinases, we identified SRC as a critical dasatinib target in IDHm ICC. Importantly, dasatinib-treated IDHm xenografts exhibited pronounced apoptosis and tumor regression. Our results show that IDHm ICC cells have a unique dependency on SRC and suggest that dasatinib may have therapeutic benefit against IDHm ICC. Moreover, these proteomic and genome-editing strategies provide a systematic and broadly applicable approach to define targets of kinase inhibitors underlying drug responsiveness. IDH mutations define a distinct subtype of ICC, a malignancy that is largely refractory to current therapies. Our work demonstrates that IDHm ICC cells are hypersensitive to dasatinib and critically dependent on SRC activity for survival and proliferation, pointing to new therapeutic strategies against these cancers.

Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 19%; an additional 19% of patients demonstrated antileukemic activity not meeting IWG criteria (partial bone marrow response and incomplete hematologic recovery). Twelve (38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profiling was consistent with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identified potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/refractory or unfit for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profile in this phase II study. Predictive markers of response consistent with BCL2 dependence were identified. Clinical and preclinical findings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate venetoclax combined with other agents in AML. Cancer Discov; 6(10); 1106-17. ©2016 AACRSee related commentary by Pullarkat and Newman, p. 1082This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1069.;;2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) exists as two enantiomers, (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, and both are implicated in tumor progression via their inhibitory effects on α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases. The former is an oncometabolite that is induced by the neomorphic activity conferred by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations, whereas the latter is produced under pathologic processes such as hypoxia. We report that IDH1/2 mutations induce a homologous recombination (HR) defect that renders tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This \"BRCAness\" phenotype of IDH mutant cells can be completely reversed by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of the mutant IDH1 enzyme, and conversely, it can be entirely recapitulated by treatment with either of the 2HG enantiomers in cells with intact IDH1/2 proteins. We demonstrate mutant IDH1-dependent PARP inhibitor sensitivity in a range of clinically relevant models, including primary patient-derived glioma cells in culture and genetically matched tumor xenografts in vivo. These findings provide the basis for a possible therapeutic strategy exploiting the biological consequences of mutant IDH, rather than attempting to block 2HG production, by targeting the 2HG-dependent HR deficiency with PARP inhibition. Furthermore, our results uncover an unexpected link between oncometabolites, altered DNA repair, and genetic instability."	;;,,Rohle D. et al.,Science,2013;;;;Chan SM. et al.,Nat.

of the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK signaling cascade is often caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins which influence the activity of this pathway and include NRAS, KRAS2, FLT3, PTPN11, and BRAF. We report the first comprehensive mutational screen of key exons of these genes in a large cohort of unselected acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases at diagnosis (n = 86) and in a more selected cohort at disease recurrence (n = 47) using the sensitive method of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. We show that somatic mutations that deregulate the pathway constitute one of the most common genetic aberrations in childhood ALL (cALL), being found in 35% of diagnostic and 25% of relapse samples. In matched presentation/relapse pairs, mutations predominating at relapse could be shown to be present at very low levels at diagnosis using allele-specific PCR, thus implicating the mutated clone in disease progression. Importantly, in primary samples, we show that mutations are associated with activated ERK and differential cytotoxicity to MEK-ERK inhibitors was shown for some patients. Inhibitors of the pathway, which are currently undergoing clinical trial, may be a novel therapeutic option for cALL, particularly at relapse.;;Deregulation of EGFR signaling is common in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and this finding led to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are highly effective in a subset of NSCLC. Mutations of EGFR (mEGFR) and copy number gains (CNGs) of EGFR (gEGFR) and HER2 (gHER2) have been reported to predict for TKI response. Mutations in KRAS (mKRAS) are associated with primary resistance to TKIs. We investigated the relationship between mutations, CNGs and response to TKIs in a large panel of NSCLC cell lines. Genes studied were EGFR, HER2, HER3 HER4, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. Mutations were detected by sequencing, while CNGs were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). IC50 values for the TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were determined by MTS assay. For any of the seven genes tested, mutations (39/77, 50.6%), copy number gains (50/77, 64.9%) or either (65/77, 84.4%) were frequent in NSCLC lines. Mutations of EGFR (13%) and KRAS (24.7%) were frequent, while they were less frequent for the other genes. The three techniques for determining CNG were well correlated, and qPCR data were used for further analyses. CNGs were relatively frequent for EGFR and KRAS in adenocarcinomas. While mutations were largely mutually exclusive, CNGs were not. EGFR and KRAS mutant lines frequently demonstrated mutant allele specific imbalance i.e. the mutant form was usually in great excess compared to the wild type form. On a molar basis, sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib were highly correlated. Multivariate analyses led to the following results: 1. mEGFR and gEGFR and gHER2 were independent factors related to gefitinib sensitivity, in descending order of importance. 2. mKRAS was associated with increased in vitro resistance to gefitinib. Our in vitro studies confirm and extend clinical observations and demonstrate the relative importance of both EGFR mutations and CNGs and HER2 CNGs in the sensitivity to TKIs.;;We have unveiled a synthetic lethal interaction between K-Ras oncogenes and Cdk4 in a mouse tumor model that closely recapitulates human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Ablation of Cdk4, but not Cdk2 or Cdk6, induces an immediate senescence response only in lung cells that express an endogenous K-Ras oncogene. No such response occurs in lungs expressing a single Cdk4 allele or in other K-Ras-expressing tissues. More importantly, targeting Cdk4 alleles in advanced tumors detectable by computed tomography scanning also induces senescence and prevents tumor progression. These observations suggest that robust and selective pharmacological inhibition of Cdk4 may provide therapeutic benefit for NSCLC patients carrying K-RAS oncogenes.;;We demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway aberrations occur in >80% of endometrioid endometrial cancers, with coordinate mutations of multiple PI3K pathway members being more common than predicted by chance. PIK3R1 (p85α) mutations occur at a higher rate in endometrial cancer than in any other tumor lineage, and PIK3R2 (p85β), not previously demonstrated to be a cancer gene, is also frequently mutated. The dominant activation event in the PI3K pathway appears to be PTEN protein loss. However, in tumors with retained PTEN protein, PI3K pathway mutations phenocopy PTEN loss, resulting in pathway activation. KRAS mutations are common in endometrioid tumors activating independent events from PI3K pathway aberrations. Multiple PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 mutations demonstrate gain of function, including disruption of a novel mechanism of pathway regulation wherein p85α dimers bind and stabilize PTEN. Taken together, the PI3K pathway represents a critical driver of endometrial cancer pathogenesis and a novel therapeutic target.,,The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is frequently activated in endometrial cancer through various PI3K/AKT-activating genetic alterations. We examined the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235--a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor--and RAD001--an mTOR inhibitor--in 13 endometrial cancer cell lines, all of which possess one or more alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and K-Ras. We also combined these compounds with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (PD98059 or UO126) in cell lines with K-Ras alterations (mutations or amplification). PTEN mutant cell lines without K-Ras alterations (n = 9) were more sensitive to both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 than were cell lines with K-Ras alterations (n = 4). Dose-dependent growth suppression was more drastically induced by NVP-BEZ235 than by RAD001 in the sensitive cell lines. G1 arrest was induced by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner. We observed in vivo antitumor activity of both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 in nude mice. The presence of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or UO126, sensitized the K-Ras mutant cells to NVP-BEZ235. Robust growth suppression by NVP-BEZ235 suggests that a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic for endometrial carcinomas. Our data suggest that mutational statuses of PTEN and K-Ras might be useful predictors of sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235 in certain endometrial carcinomas.;;Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies. We assessed the effects of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from RAS/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic CRCs (mCRC). Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%). Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%). The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%). Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original tumor and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment. The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients. However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses.;;,,The MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor GSK1120212 is currently in phase II/III clinical development. To identify predictive biomarkers, sensitivity to GSK1120212 was profiled for 218 solid tumor cell lines and 81 hematologic malignancy cell lines. For solid tumors, RAF/RAS mutation was a strong predictor of sensitivity. Among RAF/RAS mutant lines, co-occurring PIK3CA/PTEN mutations conferred a cytostatic response instead of a cytotoxic response for colon cancer cells that have the biggest representation of the comutations. Among KRAS mutant cell lines, transcriptomics analysis showed that cell lines with an expression pattern suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were less sensitive to GSK1120212. In addition, a proportion of cell lines from certain tissue types not known to carry frequent RAF/RAS mutations also seemed to be sensitive to GSK1120212. Among these were breast cancer cell lines, with triple negative breast cancer cell lines being more sensitive than cell lines from other breast cancer subtypes. We identified a single gene DUSP6, whose expression was associated with sensitivity to GSK1120212 and lack of expression associated with resistance irrelevant of RAF/RAS status. Among hematologic cell lines, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines were particularly sensitive. Overall, this comprehensive predictive biomarker analysis identified additional efficacy biomarkers for GSK1120212 in RAF/RAS mutant solid tumors and expanded the indication for GSK1120212 to patients who could benefit from this therapy despite the RAF/RAS wild-type status of their tumors.,,This study examined the status of KRAS and BRAF mutations, in relation to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in 58 ovarian carcinomas to clarify the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of KRAS/BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations of either KRAS or BRAF were identified in 12 (20.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas. The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0% : 1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3% : 10/31). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas. KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II (P<0.001), and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.001). No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy (P=0.2460, P=0.9339, respectively). Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040. Cl-1040 is a compound that selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK), an upstream regulator of ERK1/2, and thus prevents ERK1/2 activation. Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences. This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment.;;The therapeutic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed             monoclonal antibody cetuximab in gastric cancer is currently being investigated             in clinical studies. Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who             are likely to benefit from this treatment are not available. In this study, we             assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, AZ521,             Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1). The viability of two of these cell lines, AZ521 and MKN1,             was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High expression and secretion             levels of the EGFR-binding ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), were associated with cetuximab             responsiveness. MET activation and mutations in Kirsten-Ras gene (KRAS) were associated             with cetuximab resistance. By introducing a hierarchy between these markers, we             established a model that facilitated the correct classification of all five gastric             cancer cell lines as cetuximab responsive or non-responsive. The highest priority             was allocated to activating KRAS mutations, followed by MET activation and finally             by the levels of secreted AREG. In order to validate these results, we used three             additional human gastric cancer cell lines (KATOIII, MKN28 and MKN45). In conclusion,             we propose that our model allows the response of gastric cancer cell lines to             cetuximab treatment to be predicted.,,The therapeutic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibody cetuximab in gastric cancer is currently being investigated. Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from the treatment are not available. The aim of the study was to examine the drug sensitivity of five gastric cancer cell lines towards cetuximab as a single agent and to establish predictive markers for chemosensitivity in this cell culture model. The effect of a combination of cetuximab with chemotherapy was compared between a sensitive and a nonsensitive cell line. EGFR expression, activation and localisation, the presence and subcellular localisation of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as well as MET activation were examined by Western blot analysis, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of cetuximab and cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in tumour-relevant concentrations. The biological endpoint was cell viability, which was measured by XTT cell proliferation assay. Response to treatment was evaluated using statistical methods. We assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, KATOIII, MKN1, MKN28 and MKN45). The viability of two cell lines, MKN1 and MKN28, was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High EGFR expression and low levels of receptor activation were associated with cetuximab responsiveness. MET activation as well as mutations of KRAS and CDH1 (gene encoding E-cadherin) was associated with cetuximab resistance. These data indicate that our examinations may be clinically relevant, and the candidate markers should therefore be tested in clinical studies.;;The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is frequently activated in endometrial cancer through various PI3K/AKT-activating genetic alterations. We examined the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235--a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor--and RAD001--an mTOR inhibitor--in 13 endometrial cancer cell lines, all of which possess one or more alterations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and K-Ras. We also combined these compounds with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (PD98059 or UO126) in cell lines with K-Ras alterations (mutations or amplification). PTEN mutant cell lines without K-Ras alterations (n = 9) were more sensitive to both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 than were cell lines with K-Ras alterations (n = 4). Dose-dependent growth suppression was more drastically induced by NVP-BEZ235 than by RAD001 in the sensitive cell lines. G1 arrest was induced by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner. We observed in vivo antitumor activity of both RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 in nude mice. The presence of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or UO126, sensitized the K-Ras mutant cells to NVP-BEZ235. Robust growth suppression by NVP-BEZ235 suggests that a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic for endometrial carcinomas. Our data suggest that mutational statuses of PTEN and K-Ras might be useful predictors of sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235 in certain endometrial carcinomas.;;Mutant KRAS is a feature of more than 25% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and represents one of the most prevalent oncogenic drivers in this disease. NSCLC tumors with oncogenic KRAS respond poorly to current therapies, necessitating the pursuit of new treatment strategies. Targeted inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 results in the coordinated blockade of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells and has thus emerged as an attractive avenue for therapeutic intervention in human malignancies. Here, we examined the activity of ganetespib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Hsp90 currently in clinical trials for NSCLCs in a panel of lung cancer cell lines harboring a diverse spectrum of KRAS mutations. In vitro, ganetespib was potently cytotoxic in all lines, with concomitant destabilization of KRAS signaling effectors. Combinations of low-dose ganetespib with MEK or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors resulted in superior cytotoxic activity than single agents alone in a subset of mutant KRAS cells, and the antitumor efficacy of ganetespib was potentiated by cotreatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in A549 xenografts in vivo. At the molecular level, ganetespib suppressed activating feedback signaling loops that occurred in response to MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition, although this activity was not the sole determinant of combinatorial benefit. In addition, ganetespib sensitized mutant KRAS NSCLC cells to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics of the antimitotic, topoisomerase inhibitor, and alkylating agent classes. Taken together, these data underscore the promise of ganetespib as a single-agent or combination treatment in KRAS-driven lung tumors.,,Ras-driven tumors are often refractory to conventional therapies. Here we identify a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for two Ras-driven cancers: Nf1-deficient malignancies and Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer. We show that agents that enhance proteotoxic stress, including the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, induce tumor regression in aggressive mouse models, but only when combined with rapamycin. These agents synergize by promoting irresolvable ER stress, resulting in catastrophic ER and mitochondrial damage. This process is fueled by oxidative stress, which is caused by IPI-504-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, and the rapamycin-dependent suppression of glutathione, an important endogenous antioxidant. Notably, the mechanism by which these agents cooperate reveals a therapeutic paradigm that can be expanded to develop additional combinations.;;Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins function as epigenetic signaling factors that associate with acetylated histones and facilitate transcription of target genes. Inhibitors targeting the activity of BET proteins have shown potent antiproliferative effects in hematological cancers through the suppression of c-MYC and downstream target genes. However, as the epigenetic landscape of a cell varies drastically depending on lineage, transcriptional coactivators such as BETs would be expected to have different targets in cancers derived from different cells of origin, and this may influence the activity and mechanism of action of BET inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we treated a panel of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) cell lines with the BET inhibitor JQ1 and found that a subset is acutely susceptible to BET inhibition. In contrast to blood tumors, we show that LAC cells are inhibited by JQ1 through a mechanism independent of c-MYC down-regulation. Through gene expression profiling, we discovered that the oncogenic transcription factor FOSL1 and its targets are suppressed by JQ1 in a dose-dependant manner. Knockdown of BRD4 also decreased FOSL1 levels, and inhibition of FOSL1 phenocopied the effects of JQ1 treatment, suggesting that loss of this transcription factor may be partly responsible for the cytotoxic effects of BET inhibition in LAC cells, although ectopic expression of FOSL1 alone did not rescue the phenotype. Together, these findings suggest that BET inhibitors may be useful in solid tumors and that cell-lineage-specific differences in transcriptional targets of BETs may influence the activity of inhibitors of these proteins in different cancer types.,,Amplification of MYC is one of the most common genetic alterations in lung cancer, contributing to a myriad of phenotypes associated with growth, invasion, and drug resistance. Murine genetics has established both the centrality of somatic alterations of Kras in lung cancer, as well as the dependency of mutant Kras tumors on MYC function. Unfortunately, drug-like small-molecule inhibitors of KRAS and MYC have yet to be realized. The recent discovery, in hematologic malignancies, that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibition impairs MYC expression and MYC transcriptional function established the rationale of targeting KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BET inhibition. We performed functional assays to evaluate the effects of JQ1 in genetically defined NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and/or LKB1 mutations. Furthermore, we evaluated JQ1 in transgenic mouse lung cancer models expressing mutant kras or concurrent mutant kras and lkb1. Effects of bromodomain inhibition on transcriptional pathways were explored and validated by expression analysis. Although JQ1 is broadly active in NSCLC cells, activity of JQ1 in mutant KRAS NSCLC is abrogated by concurrent alteration or genetic knockdown of LKB1. In sensitive NSCLC models, JQ1 treatment results in the coordinate downregulation of the MYC-dependent transcriptional program. We found that JQ1 treatment produces significant tumor regression in mutant kras mice. As predicted, tumors from mutant kras and lkb1 mice did not respond to JQ1. Bromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant NSCLC with wild-type LKB1, via inhibition of MYC function. Clinical studies of BET bromodomain inhibitors in aggressive NSCLC will be actively pursued. Clin Cancer Res; 19(22); 6183-92. ©2013 AACR.;;No targeted therapies are available for KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib is an inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, downstream of KRAS, with preclinical evidence of synergistic activity with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant cancers. We did a prospective, randomised, phase 2 trial to assess selumetinib plus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Eligible patients were older than 18 years of age; had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB-IV KRAS-mutant NSCLC; had failed first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC; had WHO performance status of 0-1; had not received previous therapy with either a MEK inhibitor or docetaxel; and had adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to either oral selumetinib (75 mg twice daily in a 21 day cycle) or placebo; all patients received intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21 day cycle). Randomisation was done with an interactive voice response system and investigators, patients, data analysts, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed for all patients with confirmed KRAS mutations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00890825. Between April 20, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we randomly assigned 44 patients to receive selumetinib and docetaxel (selumetinib group) and 43 to receive placebo and docetaxel (placebo group). Of these, one patient in the selumetinib group and three in the placebo group were excluded from efficacy analyses because their tumours were not confirmed to be KRAS-mutation positive. Median overall survival was 9·4 months (6·8-13·6) in the selumetinib group and 5·2 months (95% CI 3·8-non-calculable) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0·80, 80% CI 0·56-1·14; one-sided p=0·21). Median progression-free survival was 5·3 months (4·6-6·4) in the selumetinib group and 2·1 months (95% CI 1·4-3·7) in the placebo group (HR for progression 0·58, 80% CI 0·42-0·79; one-sided p=0·014). 16 (37%) patients in the selumetinib group and none in the placebo group had an objective response (p<0·0001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 36 (82%) patients in the selumetinib group and 28 (67%) patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (29 [67%] of 43 patients in the selumetinib group vs 23 [55%] of 42 patients in the placebo group), febrile neutropenia (eight [18%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs none in the placebo group), dyspnoea (one [2%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs five [12%] of 42 in the placebo group), and asthenia (four [9%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs none in the placebo group). Selumetinib plus docetaxel has promising efficacy, albeit with a higher number of adverse events than with docetaxel alone, in previously treated advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. These findings warrant further clinical investigation of selumetinib plus docetaxel in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. AstraZeneca.,,This phase I expansion study assessed safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of RO4987655, a pure MEK inhibitor, in selected patients with advanced solid tumor. We undertook a multicenter phase I two-part study (dose escalation and cohort expansion). Here, we present the part 2 expansion that included melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer with oral RO4987655 administered continuously at recommended doses of 8.5 mg twice daily until progressive disease (PD). Sequential tumor sampling investigated multiple markers of pathway activation/tumor effects, including ERK phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression. BRAF and KRAS testing were implemented as selection criteria and broader tumor mutational analysis added. Ninety-five patients received RO4987655, including 18 BRAF-mutant melanoma, 23 BRAF wild-type melanoma, 24 KRAS-mutant NSCLC, and 30 KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Most frequent adverse events were rash, acneiform dermatitis, and gastrointestinal disorders, mostly grade 1/2. Four (24%) of 17 BRAF-mutated melanoma had partial response as did four (20%) of 20 BRAF wild-type melanoma and two (11%) of 18 KRAS-mutant NSCLC. All KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer developed PD. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation among all cohorts but significant differences among cohorts in Ki-67 modulation. Sixty-nine percent showed a decrease in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between baseline and day 15. Detailed mutational profiling confirmed RAS/RAF screening and identified additional aberrations (NRAS/non-BRAF melanomas; PIK3CA/KRAS colorectal cancer) without therapeutic implications. Safety profile of RO4987655 was comparable with other MEK inhibitors. Single-agent activity was observed in all entities except colorectal cancer. Evidence of target modulation and early biologic activity was shown among all indications independent of mutational status. Clin Cancer Res; 20(16); 4251-61. ©2014 AACR.,,We conducted a basket clinical trial to assess the feasibility of such a design strategy and to independently evaluate the effects of multiple targeted agents against specific molecular aberrations in multiple histologic subtypes concurrently. We enrolled patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, and thymic malignancies who underwent genomic characterization of oncogenic drivers. Patients were enrolled onto a not-otherwise-specified arm and treated with standard-of-care therapies or one of the following five biomarker-matched treatment groups: erlotinib for EGFR mutations; selumetinib for KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF mutations; MK2206 for PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN mutations; lapatinib for ERBB2 mutations or amplifications; and sunitinib for KIT or PDGFRA mutations or amplification. Six hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled, and 88% had their tumors tested for at least one gene. EGFR mutation frequency was 22.1% in NSCLC, and erlotinib achieved a response rate of 60% (95% CI, 32.3% to 83.7%). KRAS mutation frequency was 24.9% in NSCLC, and selumetinib failed to achieve its primary end point, with a response rate of 11% (95% CI, 0% to 48%). Completion of accrual to all other arms was not feasible. In NSCLC, patients with EGFR mutations had the longest median survival (3.51 years; 95% CI, 2.89 to 5.5 years), followed by those with ALK rearrangements (2.94 years; 95% CI, 1.66 to 4.61 years), those with KRAS mutations (2.3 years; 95% CI, 2.3 to 2.17 years), those with other genetic abnormalities (2.17 years; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.74 years), and those without an actionable mutation (1.85 years; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.13 years). This basket trial design was not feasible for many of the arms with rare mutations, but it allowed the study of the genetics of less common malignancies.,,KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population. Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v. every 3 weeks). Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel. Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197). Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934). There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in ≥20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia. Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC. NCT01362296.,,Patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and gallbladder carcinoma (GC) have few therapeutic options for relapsed disease. methods: Given the overall poor prognosis in this population and the availability of novel targeted therapies, we systematically analyzed the characteristics and outcomes for GC and CC patients treated on phase I trials with an emphasis on targeted agents and locoregional therapies. Of 40 treated patients (GC=6; CC=34; median age, 60 years), 8 (20%) had stable disease (SD) > 6 months, 3 (8%) partial response (PR), on protocols with hepatic arterial drug infusion and anti-angiogenic, anti-HER-2/neu or novel MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Median progression-free survival (PFS) on phase I trials was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.7, 2.8) versus 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 5.0), 3.0 months (95% CI 2.3, 4.6), and 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 3.9) for their first-, second-, and last-line FDA-approved therapy. In univariate analysis, >3 metastatic sites, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (>56IU/L), serum creatinine (>1.6mg/dL), and CA19-9 (>35U/mL) were associated with a shorter PFS. Mutational analysis revealed mutation in the KRAS oncogene in 2 of 11 patients (18%). The SD >6 months/PR rate of 28% was seen with hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin, and inhibitors of angiogenesis, HER-2/neu or MEK. The PFS in phase I trials was similar to that of the first, second, and last-line therapy (P=0.95, 0.98, 0.76, respectively) with FDA-approved agents given in the advanced setting, emphasizing a role for targeted agents in a clinical trials setting as potentially valuable therapeutic options for these patients.;;KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene, yet no effective targeted therapies exist for KRAS mutant cancers. We developed a pooled shRNA-drug screen strategy to identify genes that, when inhibited, cooperate with MEK inhibitors to effectively treat KRAS mutant cancer cells. The anti-apoptotic BH3 family gene BCL-XL emerged as a top hit through this approach. ABT-263 (navitoclax), a chemical inhibitor that blocks the ability of BCL-XL to bind and inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins, in combination with a MEK inhibitor led to dramatic apoptosis in many KRAS mutant cell lines from different tissue types. This combination caused marked in vivo tumor regressions in KRAS mutant xenografts and in a genetically engineered KRAS-driven lung cancer mouse model, supporting combined BCL-XL/MEK inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for KRAS mutant cancers.;;Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often expresses mutant KRAS together with tumor-associated mutations of the CDKN2A locus, which are associated with aggressive, therapy-resistant tumors. Here, we unravel specific requirements for the maintenance of NSCLC that carries this genotype. We establish that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/RHOA/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) network is deregulated in high-grade lung tumors. Suppression of RHOA or FAK induces cell death selectively in mutant KRAS;INK4A/ARF-deficient lung cancer cells. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of FAK caused tumor regression specifically in the high-grade lung cancer that developed in mutant Kras;Cdkn2a-null mice. These findings provide a rationale for the rapid implementation of genotype-specific targeted therapies using FAK inhibitors in patients with cancer. Targeted therapies are effective for only a small fraction of patients with cancer. We report that FAK inhibitors exert potent antitumor effects in NSCLCs that express mutant KRAS in association with INK4A/ARF deficiency. These results reveal a novel genotype-specific vulnerability of cancer cells that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.;;This phase 1b study determined the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of trametinib in combination with gemcitabine. Secondary objectives included assessment of clinical activity and steady-state pharmacokinetics. Adults with advanced solid tumours, adequate organ function and Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ⩽ 1 were eligible. Once-daily oral trametinib (1mg, 2mg, 2.5mg) was escalated in a 3+3 design with standard gemcitabine dosing (1000 mg/m(2) IV Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles). During expansion, trametinib 2mg was combined with gemcitabine. Pharmacokinetics samples were collected on Day 15 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 6h post-dose; tumour assessments were repeated every two cycles. Between 8/2009 and 11/2010, 31 patients (pancreas = 11, breast = 6, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) = 4, other = 10) were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in each cohort, and included febrile neutropenia, transaminase elevation and uveitis. The RP2D was declared as trametinib 2mg daily with standard gemcitabine dosing. Common grade 3/4 toxicities at the RP2D included: neutropenia (38%), thrombocytopenia (19%) and transaminase elevation (14%). Of 10 patients with measurable pancreatic cancer, three partial responses (30%) were documented; two additional patients achieved objective responses (breast, complete response (CR); salivary glands, partial response (PR)). Pharmacokinetics suggested no change in exposures of either drug in combination. Administration of trametinib at its full monotherapy dose of 2mg daily in combination with standard gemcitabine dosing (1000 mg/m(2) IV Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) was feasible. Though most toxicities were manageable, the addition of trametinib may increase gemcitabine-associated myelosuppression. Future studies of this combination will require monitoring to maintain dose and schedule.;;The high frequency of activating RAS or BRAF mutations in cancer provides strong rationale for targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors. ;;Results from clinical trials involving resistance to molecularly targeted therapies have revealed the importance of rational single-agent and combination treatment strategies. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)/insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, OSI-906, in combination with a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor based on evidence that the MAP kinase pathway was upregulated in colorectal cancer cell lines that were resistant to OSI-906. The antiproliferative effects of OSI-906 and the MEK 1/2 inhibitor U0126 were analyzed both as single agents and in combination in 13 colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. Apoptosis, downstream effector proteins, and cell cycle were also assessed. In addition, the efficacy of OSI-906 combined with the MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) was evaluated in vivo using human colorectal cancer xenograft models. The combination of OSI-906 and U0126 resulted in synergistic effects in 11 of 13 colorectal cancer cell lines tested. This synergy was variably associated with apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest in addition to molecular effects on prosurvival pathways. The synergy was also reflected in the in vivo xenograft studies following treatment with the combination of OSI-906 and selumetinib. Results from this study demonstrate synergistic antiproliferative effects in response to the combination of OSI-906 with an MEK 1/2 inhibitor in colorectal cancer cell line models both in vitro and in vivo, which supports the rational combination of OSI-906 with an MEK inhibitor in patients with colorectal cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 19(22); 6219-29. ©2013 AACR.;;Colorectal cancers harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are refractory to current targeted therapies. Using data from a high-throughput drug screen, we have developed a novel therapeutic strategy that targets the apoptotic machinery using the BCL-2 family inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax) in combination with a TORC1/2 inhibitor, AZD8055. This combination leads to efficient apoptosis specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-mutant but not wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer cells. This specific susceptibility results from TORC1/2 inhibition leading to suppression of MCL-1 expression in mutant, but not WT, colorectal cancers, leading to abrogation of BIM/MCL-1 complexes. This combination strategy leads to tumor regressions in both KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of colorectal cancer, but not in the corresponding KRAS-WT colorectal cancer models. These data suggest that the combination of BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors with TORC1/2 inhibitors constitutes a promising targeted therapy strategy to treat these recalcitrant cancers. ;;Although the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis are well established, KRAS activates additional pathways required for tumor maintenance, the inhibition of which are likely to be necessary for effective KRAS-directed therapy. Here, we show that the IκB kinase (IKK)-related kinases Tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IKKε promote KRAS-driven tumorigenesis by regulating autocrine CCL5 and interleukin (IL)-6 and identify CYT387 as a potent JAK/TBK1/IKKε inhibitor. CYT387 treatment ablates RAS-associated cytokine signaling and impairs Kras-driven murine lung cancer growth. Combined CYT387 treatment and MAPK pathway inhibition induces regression of aggressive murine lung adenocarcinomas driven by Kras mutation and p53 loss. These observations reveal that TBK1/IKKε promote tumor survival by activating CCL5 and IL-6 and identify concurrent inhibition of TBK1/IKKε, Janus-activated kinase (JAK), and MEK signaling as an effective approach to inhibit the actions of oncogenic KRAS. ;;Colorectal cancers (CRCs) that are sensitive to the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab almost always develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. We report the emergence of polyclonal KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in CRC cells with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Regardless of the genetic alterations, resistant cells consistently displayed mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which persisted after EGFR blockade. Inhibition of MEK1/2 alone failed to impair the growth of resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. An RNA interference screen demonstrated that suppression of EGFR, together with silencing of MEK1/2, was required to hamper the proliferation of resistant cells. Indeed, concomitant pharmacological blockade of MEK and EGFR induced prolonged ERK inhibition and severely impaired the growth of resistant tumor cells. Heterogeneous and concomitant mutations in KRAS and NRAS were also detected in plasma samples from patients who developed resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. A mouse xenotransplant from a CRC patient who responded and subsequently relapsed upon EGFR therapy showed exquisite sensitivity to combinatorial treatment with MEK and EGFR inhibitors. Collectively, these results identify genetically distinct mechanisms that mediate secondary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, all of which reactivate ERK signaling. These observations provide a rational strategy to overcome the multifaceted clonal heterogeneity that emerges when tumors are treated with targeted agents. We propose that MEK inhibitors, in combination with cetuximab or panitumumab, should be tested in CRC patients who become refractory to anti-EGFR therapies. ;;;;There is an unmet need for treatment options in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. Refametinib, an oral, allosteric MEK inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. A phase II study evaluated efficacy and safety of refametinib plus sorafenib in Asian patients with HCC (NCT01204177). Eligible patients received twice-daily refametinib 50 mg plus twice-daily sorafenib 200 mg (morning)/400 mg (evening), with dose escalation to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily from cycle 2 if no grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, or gastrointestinal toxicity occurred. Primary efficacy endpoint: disease control rate. Secondary endpoints: time to progression, overall survival, pharmacokinetic assessment, biomarker analysis, safety, and tolerability. Of 95 enrolled patients, 70 received study treatment. Most patients had liver cirrhosis (82.9%) and hepatitis B viral infection (75.7%). Disease control rate was 44.8% (primary efficacy analysis; n = 58). Median time to progression was 122 days, median overall survival was 290 days (n = 70). Best clinical responders had RAS mutations; majority of poor responders had wild-type RAS. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, vomiting, and nausea. Dose modifications due to adverse events were necessary in almost all patients. Refametinib plus sorafenib showed antitumor activity in patients with HCC and was tolerated at reduced doses by most patients. Frequent dose modifications due to grade 3 adverse events may have contributed to limited treatment effect. Patients with RAS mutations appear to benefit from refametinib/sorafenib combination.;;KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene in human tumors. KRAS-mutant cells may exhibit resistance to the allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) and allosteric AKT inhibitors (such as MK-2206), the combination of which may overcome resistance to both monotherapies. We conducted a dose/schedule-finding study evaluating MK-2206 and selumetinib in patients with advanced treatment-refractory solid tumors. Recommended dosing schedules were defined as MK-2206 at 135 mg weekly and selumetinib at 100 mg once daily. Grade 3 rash was the most common dose-limiting toxicity (DLT); other DLTs included grade 4 lipase increase, grade 3 stomatitis, diarrhea, and fatigue, and grade 3 and grade 2 retinal pigment epithelium detachment. There were no meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Clinical antitumor activity included RECIST 1.0-confirmed partial responses in non-small cell lung cancer and low-grade ovarian carcinoma. Responses in KRAS-mutant cancers were generally durable. Clinical cotargeting of MEK and AKT signaling may be an important therapeutic strategy in KRAS-driven human malignancies (Trial NCT number NCT01021748).;;Decitabine, a cancer therapeutic that inhibits DNA methylation, produces variable antitumor response rates in patients with solid tumors that might be leveraged clinically with identification of a predictive biomarker. In this study, we profiled the response of human ovarian, melanoma, and breast cancer cells treated with decitabine, finding that RAS/MEK/ERK pathway activation and DNMT1 expression correlated with cytotoxic activity. Further, we showed that KRAS genomic status predicted decitabine sensitivity in low-grade and high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells. Pretreatment with decitabine decreased the cytotoxic activity of MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cells, with reciprocal downregulation of DNMT1 and MEK/ERK phosphorylation. In parallel with these responses, decitabine also upregulated the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BNIP3, which is known to be regulated by MEK and ERK, and heightened the activity of proapoptotic small-molecule navitoclax, a BCL-2 family inhibitor. In a xenograft model of KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer, combining decitabine and navitoclax heightened antitumor activity beyond administration of either compound alone. Our results define the RAS/MEK/DNMT1 pathway as a determinant of sensitivity to DNA methyltransferase inhibition, specifically implicating KRAS status as a biomarker of drug response in ovarian cancer.;;Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to have bona fide tumor suppressor activity. However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity. These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of EZH2. ;;KRAS mutations in NSCLC are associated with a lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) is an oral selective MEK kinase inhibitor of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients failing one to two prior regimens underwent KRAS profiling. KRAS wild-type patients were randomized to erlotinib (150 mg daily) or a combination of selumetinib (150 mg daily) with erlotinib (100 mg daily). KRAS mutant patients were randomized to selumetinib (75 mg b.i.d.) or the combination. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) for the KRAS wild-type cohort and objective response rate (ORR) for the KRAS mutant cohort. Biomarker studies of ERK phosphorylation and immune subsets were carried out. From March 2010 to May 2013, 89 patients were screened; 41 KRAS mutant and 38 KRAS wild-type patients were enrolled. Median PFS in the KRAS wild-type arm was 2.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-3.7] for erlotinib alone and 2.1 months (95% CI 1.8-5.1) for the combination. The ORR in the KRAS mutant group was 0% (95% CI 0.0% to 33.6%) for selumetinib alone and 10% (95% CI 2.1% to 26.3%) for the combination. Combination therapy resulted in increased toxicities, requiring dose reductions (56%) and discontinuation (8%). Programmed cell death-1 expression on regulatory T cells (Tregs), Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells and Th17 levels were associated with PFS and overall survival in patients receiving selumetinib. This study failed to show improvement in ORR or PFS with combination therapy of selumetinib and erlotinib over monotherapy in KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type advanced NSCLC. The association of immune subsets and immune checkpoint receptor expression with selumetinib may warrant further studies.;;Though the efficacy of MEK inhibitors is being investigated in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers (CRC), early clinical trials of MEK inhibitor monotherapy did not reveal significant antitumor activity. Resistance to MEK inhibitor monotherapy developed through a variety of mechanisms converging in ERK reactivation. Since ERK increases cyclin D expression and increases entry into the cell cycle, we hypothesized that the combination of MEK inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors would have synergistic antitumor activity and cause tumor regression in vivo. The combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors synergistically inhibited cancer cell growth in vitro and caused tumor regression in vivo in cell line and patient-derived xenograft models. Combination therapy markedly decreased levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 both in vitro and in vivo and decreased Ki67 staining in vivo. We performed in vitro proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and senescence assays, and Western blots, on a panel of 11 KRAS mutant CRC cell lines treated with the MEK inhibitor MEK162, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, or the combination. We also treated 4 KRAS mutant CRC cell line and patient-derived xenografts with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, or the combination, and performed immunohistochemical and reverse phase protein array analysis. Combined inhibition of both MEK and CDK4/6 is effective in preclinical models of KRAS mutant CRC and justifies a planned phase II clinical trial in patients with refractory KRAS-mutant CRC.Efficacy of the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer models.;;We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of abemaciclib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, in a multicenter study including phase I dose escalation followed by tumor-specific cohorts for breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. A total of 225 patients were enrolled: 33 in dose escalation and 192 in tumor-specific cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was 200 mg every 12 hours. The most common possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events involved fatigue and the gastrointestinal, renal, or hematopoietic systems. Plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacodynamic effects were observed in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors. Radiographic responses were achieved in previously treated patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the overall response rate was 31%; moreover, 61% of patients achieved either response or stable disease lasting ≥6 months. Abemaciclib represents the first selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 with a safety profile allowing continuous dosing to achieve sustained target inhibition. This first-in-human experience demonstrates single-agent activity for patients with advanced breast cancer, NSCLC, and other solid tumors.

KRAS itself has proved difficult to inhibit, and the effectiveness of agents that target key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that limit their efficacy as single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying combination targets for trametinib, a MEK inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which acts downstream of KRAS to suppress signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Informed by a short-hairpin RNA screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signalling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities: it is dominated by FGFR1 in KRAS-mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patients’ tumours treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results demonstrate that FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate a combinatorial approach for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.	,,;;;;,,;;;;;;,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Case M. et al.,Cancer Res.,2008;;Gandhi J. et al.,PLoS ONE,2009;;Puyol M. et al.,Cancer Cell,2010;;Cheung LW. et al.,Cancer Discov,2011,,Shoji K. et al.,PLoS ONE,2012;;Migliardi G. et al.,Clin.

We performed Sanger sequencing of all exons of the HER2 gene in 1,248 primary tumors and 18 paired metastatic samples. Novel HER2 mutations were functionally characterized. The total HER2 somatic mutation rate was 2.24% (28/1,248).

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis.

Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	Garner AP. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014

Recently, the F877L mutation has been described to convert enzalutamide into an agonist. This mutation was seen to co-occur in the endogenous AR allele of LNCaP cells, next to the T878A mutation. Here, we studied the effects of enzalutamide on the F877L and T878A mutants, as well as the double-mutant AR (F877L/T878A). Molecular modeling revealed favorable structural changes in the double-mutant AR that lead to a decrease in steric clashes for enzalutamide. Ligand-binding assays confirmed that the F877L mutation leads to an increase in relative binding affinity for enzalutamide, but only the combination with the T878A mutation resulted in a strong agonistic activity. This correlated with changes in coregulator recruitment and chromatin interactions. Our data show that enzalutamide is only a very weak partial agonist of the AR F877L, and a strong partial agonist of the double-mutant AR. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(7); 1702-12. ©2016 AACR.

PIK3R1 (p85α) mutations occur at a higher rate in endometrial cancer than in any other tumor lineage, and PIK3R2 (p85β), not previously demonstrated to be a cancer gene, is also frequently mutated. The dominant activation event in the PI3K pathway appears to be PTEN protein loss. However, in tumors with retained PTEN protein, PI3K pathway mutations phenocopy PTEN loss, resulting in pathway activation. KRAS mutations are common in endometrioid tumors activating independent events from PI3K pathway aberrations. Multiple PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 mutations demonstrate gain of function, including disruption of a novel mechanism of pathway regulation wherein p85α dimers bind and stabilize PTEN. Taken together, the PI3K pathway represents a critical driver of endometrial cancer pathogenesis and a novel therapeutic target.,,Members of the mammalian phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) family of proteins are critical regulators of various cellular process including cell survival, growth, proliferation, and motility. Oncogenic activating mutations in the p110alpha catalytic subunit of the heterodimeric p110/p85 PI3K enzyme are frequent in human cancers. Here we show the presence of frequent mutations in p85alpha in colon cancer, a majority of which occurs in the inter-Src homology-2 (iSH2) domain. These mutations uncouple and retain p85alpha's p110-stabilizing activity, while abrogating its p110-inhibitory activity. The p85alpha mutants promote cell survival, AKT activation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and oncogenesis in a p110-dependent manner.

Progestagens, estradiol and anti-androgens can compete with androgens for binding to the androgen receptor and can stimulate both cell growth and excretion of prostate specific acid phosphatase. We have discovered in the LNCaP androgen receptor a single point mutation changing the sense of codon 868 (Thr to Ala) in the ligand binding domain. Expression vectors containing the normal or mutated androgen receptor sequence were transfected into COS or Hela cells. Androgens, progestagens, estrogens and anti-androgens bind the mutated androgen receptor protein and activate the expression of an androgen-regulated reporter gene construct (GRE-tk-CAT). The mutation therefore influences both binding and the induction of gene expression by different steroids and antisteroids.;;Androgen receptor (AR) gene aberrations are rare in prostate cancer before primary hormone treatment but emerge with castration resistance. To determine AR gene status using a minimally invasive assay that could have broad clinical utility, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing approach amenable to plasma DNA, covering all AR coding bases and genomic regions that are highly informative in prostate cancer. We sequenced 274 plasma samples from 97 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone at two institutions. We controlled for normal DNA in patients' circulation and detected a sufficiently high tumor DNA fraction to quantify AR copy number state in 217 samples (80 patients). Detection of AR copy number gain and point mutations in plasma were inversely correlated, supported further by the enrichment of nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations in AR copy number normal as opposed to AR gain samples. Whereas AR copy number was unchanged from before treatment to progression and no mutant AR alleles showed signal for acquired gain, we observed emergence of T878A or L702H AR amino acid changes in 13% of tumors at progression on abiraterone. Patients with AR gain or T878A or L702H before abiraterone (45%) were 4.9 and 7.8 times less likely to have a ≥50 or ≥90% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), respectively, and had a significantly worse overall [hazard ratio (HR), 7.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.51 to 15.34; P = 1.3 × 10(-9)) and progression-free (HR, 3.73; 95% CI, 2.17 to 6.41; P = 5.6 × 10(-7)) survival. Evaluation of plasma AR by next-generation sequencing could identify cancers with primary resistance to abiraterone.	Veldscholte J. et al.,Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

Recently, rare targetable gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene, have been identified in 1-5% of lung cancers, suggesting that similar rare gene fusions may occur in other common epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement-negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1-v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion-harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types.,,To identify druggable oncogenic fusions in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) of the lung, a malignant type of lung adenocarcinoma in which KRAS mutations frequently occur. From an IMA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%) with KRAS mutations and 34 cases without (38%), we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutations. We used the sequencing data to identify gene fusions, and then performed functional analyses of the fusion gene products. We identified oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET. NRG1 fusions were present in 17.6% (6/34) of KRAS-negative IMAs. The CD74-NRG1 fusion activated HER2:HER3 signaling, whereas the EZR-ERBB4 and TRIM24-BRAF fusions constitutively activated the ERBB4 and BRAF kinases, respectively. Signaling pathway activation and fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth/tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells expressing these fusions were suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for clinical use.

We sought to identify additional potential drivers in \"pan-negative\" melanoma. Using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay (FoundationOne™) and targeted RNA sequencing, we identified a novel PAPSS1-BRAF fusion in a \"pan-negative\" melanoma. We then analyzed NGS data from 51 additional melanomas genotyped by FoundationOne™, as well as melanoma RNA, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to determine the potential frequency of BRAF fusions in melanoma. We characterized the signaling properties of confirmed molecular alterations by ectopic expression of engineered cDNAs in 293H cells. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cells by ectopic expression of PAPSS1-BRAF was abrogated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition but not by BRAF inhibition. NGS data analysis of 51 additional melanomas revealed a second BRAF fusion (TRIM24-BRAF) in a \"pan-negative\" sample; MAPK signaling induced by TRIM24-BRAF was also MEK inhibitor sensitive. Through mining TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma dataset, we further identified two potential BRAF fusions in another 49 \"pan-negative\" cases. BRAF fusions define a new molecular subset of melanoma, potentially comprising 4% to 8% of \"pan-negative\" cases. Their presence may explain an unexpected clinical response to MEK inhibitor therapy or assist in selecting patients for MEK-directed therapy.,,Although recurrent gene fusions involving erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors are common in prostate cancer, their products are considered 'undruggable' by conventional approaches.

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01524978.).;;No effective systemic therapy exists for patients with metastatic low-grade serous (LGS) ovarian cancers. BRAF and KRAS mutations are common in serous borderline (SB) and LGS ovarian cancers, and MEK inhibition has been shown to induce tumor regression in a minority of patients; however, no correlation has been observed between mutation status and clinical response. With the goal of identifying biomarkers of sensitivity to MEK inhibitor treatment, we performed an outlier analysis of a patient who experienced a complete, durable, and ongoing (> 5 years) response to selumetinib, a non-ATP competitive MEK inhibitor. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze this patient's tumor as well as an additional 28 SB/LGS tumors. Functional characterization of an identified novel alteration of interest was performed. Analysis of the extraordinary responder's tumor identified a 15-nucleotide deletion in the negative regulatory helix of the MAP2K1 gene encoding for MEK1. Functional characterization demonstrated that this mutant induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation, promoted anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in mice, and retained sensitivity to selumetinib. Analysis of additional LGS/SB tumors identified mutations predicted to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation in 82% (23 of 28), including two patients with BRAF fusions, one of whom achieved an ongoing complete response to MEK inhibitor-based combination therapy. Alterations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are present in the majority of patients with LGS ovarian cancer. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed deletions and fusions that are not detected by older sequencing approaches. These findings, coupled with the observation that a subset of patients with recurrent LGS ovarian cancer experienced dramatic and durable responses to MEK inhibitor therapy, support additional clinical studies of MEK inhibitors in this disease.;;We have identified previously undiscovered BRAF in-frame deletions near the αC-helix region of the kinase domain in pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancers. These deletions are mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations and occur in 4.21% of KRAS wild-type pancreatic cancer. siRNA knockdown in cells harboring BRAF deletions showed that the MAPK activity and cell growth are BRAF dependent. Structurally, the BRAF deletions are predicted to shorten the β3/αC-helix loop and hinder its flexibility by locking the helix in the active αC-helix-in conformation that favors dimer formation. Expression of L485-P490-deleted BRAF is able to transform NIH/3T3 cells in a BRAF dimer-dependent manner. BRAF homodimer is confirmed to be the dominant RAF dimer by proximity ligation assays in BRAF deletion cells, which are resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and sensitive to LY3009120, a RAF dimer inhibitor. In tumor models with BRAF deletions, LY3009120 has shown tumor growth regression, whereas vemurafenib is inactive. This study discovered oncogenic BRAF deletions with a distinct activation mechanism dependent on the BRAF dimer formation in tumor cells. LY3009120 is active against these cells and represents a potential treatment option for patients with cancer with these BRAF deletions, or other atypical BRAF mutations where BRAF functions as a dimer.;;We have identified previously undiscovered BRAF in-frame deletions near the αC-helix region of the kinase domain in pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancers.

The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab in BRAF-mutated malignancies are not defined. In this 3+3 phase I study, patients with BRAFV600E-advanced solid cancers received cetuximab and irinotecan with escalating doses of vemurafenib. Nineteen patients (18 with metastatic colorectal cancer and 1 with appendiceal cancer) were enrolled. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The MTD of vemurafenib was 960 mg twice daily. Six of 17 evaluable patients (35%) achieved a radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, consistent with in vivo models demonstrating tumor regressions with the triplet regimen. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months. BRAFV600E circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) trends correlated with radiographic changes, and acquired mutations from cfDNA in genes reactivating MAPK signaling were observed at progression. Vemurafenib, in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab, was well tolerated in patients with refractory, BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, and both survival outcomes and response rates exceeded prior reports for vemurafenib and for irinotecan plus cetuximab in BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal cancer. In vivo models demonstrated regressions with the triplet, in contrast with vemurafenib and cetuximab alone. cfDNA predicted radiographic response and identified mutations reactivating the MAPK pathway upon progression.

Patients with refractory BRAFV600-mutant metastatic CRC (mCRC) were treated with a selective RAF kinase inhibitor (encorafenib) plus a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR (cetuximab), with (n = 28) or without (n = 26) a PI3Kα inhibitor (alpelisib). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended phase II dose. Dose-limiting toxicities were reported in 3 patients receiving dual treatment and 2 patients receiving triple treatment. The MTD was not reached for either group and the phase II doses were selected as 200 mg encorafenib (both groups) and 300 mg alpelisib. Combinations of cetuximab and encorafenib showed promising clinical activity and tolerability in patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC; confirmed overall response rates of 19% and 18% were observed and median progression-free survival was 3.7 and 4.2 months for the dual- and triple-therapy groups, respectively.Significance: Herein, we demonstrate that dual- (encorafenib plus cetuximab) and triple- (encorafenib plus cetuximab and alpelisib) combination treatments are tolerable and provide promising clinical activity in the difficult-to-treat patient population with BRAF-mutant mCRC.

In a phase I trial of PD0332991, several patients with WDLS or DDLS experienced prolonged stable disease. We performed an open-label phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of PD0332991 in patients with advanced WDLS/DDLS. Patients age ≥ 18 years experiencing disease progression while receiving systemic therapy before enrollment received PD0332991 200 mg orally once per day for 14 consecutive days in 21-day cycles. All were required to have CDK4 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and retinoblastoma protein (RB) expression by immunohistochemistry (≥ 1+). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks, with 12-week PFS of ≥ 40% considered promising and ≤ 20% not promising. If ≥ nine of 28 patients were progression free at 12 weeks, PD0332991 would be considered active. We screened 48 patients (44 of 48 had CDK4 amplification; 41 of 44 were RB positive). Of those, 30 were enrolled, and 29 were evaluable for the primary end point. Grade 3 to 4 events included anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (30%), neutropenia (50%), and febrile neutropenia (3%). At 12 weeks, PFS was 66% (90% CI, 51% to 100%), significantly exceeding the primary end point. The median PFS was 18 weeks. There was one partial response. Treatment with the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 was associated with a favorable progression-free rate in patients with CDK4-amplified and RB-expressing WDLS/DDLS who had progressive disease despite systemic therapy.

The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML. We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients. We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.

FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently amplified in liposarcomas. The significance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we first comparatively examined the amplification and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Amplification and expression of the three genes were identified in 90% to 100% (9-11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55% (41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these \"UHGPS\" may represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 significantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT and repressed cell proliferation. These findings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may play a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target."	Zhang K. et al.,Cancer Res.,2013

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.;;;;Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated target in different human malignancies. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to contribute considerably to the extension of progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EGFR have also improved the efficacy outcomes in KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, a significant percentage of lung and colorectal cancer patients do not respond to anti-EGFR agents and secondary resistance after initial benefit is a challenging reality faced by clinicians. Extensive preclinical work on the potential mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in different disease settings has guided the development of second-generation irreversible EGFR TKIs, more efficient anti-EGFR mAbs, and combination strategies with agents targeting other receptors and downstream effectors. In order to elucidate the role of the multiple therapeutic strategies under investigation to overcome EGFR inhibitors-resistance, rational drug development based on stringent preclinical data, biomarker validation and proper selection of patients in the ongoing clinical trials are of paramount importance. Preliminary results of clinical trials evaluating these approaches will be discussed in this manuscript, with emphasis on TKIs in lung cancer and mAbs in advanced colorectal cancer.,,EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibodies are effective in a subset of metastatic colorectal cancers. Inevitably, all patients develop resistance, which occurs through emergence of KRAS mutations in approximately 50% of the cases. We show that amplification of the MET proto-oncogene is associated with acquired resistance in tumors that do not develop KRAS mutations during anti-EGFR therapy. Amplification of the MET locus was present in circulating tumor DNA before relapse was clinically evident. Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors. These results highlight the role of MET in mediating primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer and encourage the use of MET inhibitors in patients displaying resistance as a result of MET amplification.;;Therapeutic strategies that target the tyrosine kinase MET hold promise for gastric cancer, but the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of such strategies remains unclear. We examined the antitumor action of the MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) in gastric cancer cells positive or negative for MET amplification. Inhibition of MET signaling by crizotinib or RNA interference-mediated MET depletion resulted in induction of apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells with MET amplification but not in those without it, suggesting that MET signaling is essential for the survival of MET amplification-positive cells. Crizotinib upregulated the expression of BIM, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as well as downregulated that of survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and c-IAP1, members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in cells with MET amplification. Forced depletion of BIM inhibited crizotinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that upregulation of BIM contributes to the proapoptotic effect of crizotinib. Crizotinib also exhibited a marked antitumor effect in gastric cancer xenografts positive for MET amplification, whereas it had little effect on those negative for this genetic change. Crizotinib thus shows a marked antitumor action both in vitro and in vivo specifically in gastric cancer cells positive for MET amplification.,,Our aim was to investigate both the prevalence of MET amplification in gastric cancer as well as the potential of this genetic alteration to serve as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer. MET amplification was assessed by initial screening with a PCR-based copy number assay followed by confirmatory FISH analysis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of gastric cancer obtained at surgery. The effects of MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs) in gastric cancer cells with or without MET amplification were also examined. The median MET copy number in 266 cases of gastric cancer was 1.7, with a range of 0.41 to 21.3. We performed FISH analysis for the 15 cases with the highest MET copy numbers. MET amplification was confirmed in the four assessable cases with a MET copy number of at least 4, whereas MET amplification was not detected in those with a gene copy number of less than 4. The prevalence of MET amplification was thus 1.5% (4 out of 266 cases). Inhibition of MET by MET-TKIs resulted in the induction of apoptosis accompanied by attenuation of downstream MET signaling in gastric cancer cell lines with MET amplification but not in those without this genetic change. MET amplification identifies a small but clinically important subgroup of gastric cancer patients who are likely to respond to MET-TKIs. Furthermore, screening with a PCR-based copy number assay is an efficient way to reduce the number of patients requiring confirmation of MET amplification by FISH analysis.;;Foretinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET, VEGF, RON, AXL, and TIE-2 receptors. Activating mutations or amplifications in MET have been described in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of foretinib in patients with PRCC. Patients were enrolled onto the study in two cohorts with different dosing schedules of foretinib: cohort A, 240 mg once per day on days 1 through 5 every 14 days (intermittent arm); cohort B, 80 mg daily (daily dosing arm). Patients were stratified on the basis of MET pathway activation (germline or somatic MET mutation, MET [7q31] amplification, or gain of chromosome 7). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Overall, 74 patients were enrolled, with 37 in each dosing cohort. ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 was 13.5%, median progression-free survival was 9.3 months, and median overall survival was not reached. The presence of a germline MET mutation was highly predictive of a response (five of 10 v five of 57 patients with and without germline MET mutations, respectively). The most frequent adverse events of any grade associated with foretinib were fatigue, hypertension, gastrointestinal toxicities, and nonfatal pulmonary emboli. Foretinib demonstrated activity in patients with advanced PRCC with a manageable toxicity profile and a high response rate in patients with germline MET mutations.,,;;EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibodies are effective in a subset of metastatic colorectal cancers.

We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models. We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRASG12S mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR/MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations. ;;Pediatric glioblastoma is one of the most common and most deadly brain tumors in childhood. Using an integrative genetic analysis of 53 pediatric glioblastomas and five in vitro model systems, we identified previously unidentified gene fusions involving the MET oncogene in ∼10% of cases. These MET fusions activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and, in cooperation with lesions compromising cell cycle regulation, induced aggressive glial tumors in vivo. MET inhibitors suppressed MET tumor growth in xenograft models. Finally, we treated a pediatric patient bearing a MET-fusion-expressing glioblastoma with the targeted inhibitor crizotinib. This therapy led to substantial tumor shrinkage and associated relief of symptoms, but new treatment-resistant lesions appeared, indicating that combination therapies are likely necessary to achieve a durable clinical response.;;Purpose Patients with advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) have limited therapeutic options. PRCC may involve activation of the MET pathway, for example, through gene amplification or mutations. Savolitinib (AZD6094, HMPL-504, volitinib) is a highly selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We report results of a single-arm, multicenter, phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of savolitinib in patients with PRCC according to MET status. Patients and Methods Patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic PRCC were enrolled and received savolitinib 600 mg orally once daily. MET-driven PRCC was defined as any of the following: chromosome 7 copy gain, focal MET or HGF gene amplification, or MET kinase domain mutations. Efficacy was assessed according to MET status. Safety, toxicity, and patient-reported health-related quality-of-life outcomes were assessed in all patients. Results Of 109 patients treated, PRCC was MET driven in 44 (40%) and MET independent in 46 (42%); MET status was unknown in 19 (17%). MET-driven PRCC was strongly associated with response; there were eight confirmed partial responders with MET-driven disease (18%), but none with MET-independent disease ( P = .002). Median progression-free survival for patients with MET-driven and MET-independent PRCC was 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0 months) and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.7 months), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.52; log-rank P < .001). The most frequent adverse events associated with savolitinib were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and peripheral edema. Conclusion These data show activity and tolerability of savolitinib in the subgroup of patients with MET-driven PRCC. Furthermore, molecular characterization of MET status was more predictive of response to savolitinib than a classification based on pathology. These findings justify investigating savolitinib in MET-driven PRCC.	;;,,,,;;;;;;,,;;Zou HY. et al.,Cancer Res.,2007;;Chi AS. et al.,J. Clin.

It inhibits angiogenic pathways by mainly targeting the receptors of VEGF and PDGF. In ccRCC, angiogenesis is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) which in turn leads to the induction of HIF1α target genes such as CA9 and VEGF. Furthermore, the angiogenic phenotype of ccRCC is also reflected by endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) or other tumor-promoting factors like Ki67 or survivin. Tissue microarrays from primary tumor specimens of 42 patients with metastatic ccRCC under sunitinib therapy were immunohistochemically stained for selected markers related to angiogenesis. The prognostic and predictive potential of theses markers was assessed on the basis of the objective response rate which was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria after 3, 6, 9 months and after last report (12-54 months) of sunitinib treatment. Additionally, VHL copy number and mutation analyses were performed on DNA from cryo-preserved tumor tissues of 20 ccRCC patients. Immunostaining of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β was significantly associated with the sunitinib response after 6 and 9 months as well as last report under therapy. Furthermore, HIF-1α, CA9, CD34, VEGFR1 and -3 and PDGRFα showed significant associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses high CA9 membrane staining and a response after 9 months were independent prognostic factors for longer OS. Frequently observed copy number loss and mutation of VHL gene lead to altered expression of VHL, HIF-1α, CA9, and VEGF. Immunoexpression of HIF-1α, CA9, Ki67, CD31, pVEGFR1, VEGFR1 and -2, pPDGFRα and -β in the primary tumors of metastatic ccRCC patients might support the prediction of a good response to sunitinib treatment.

The present study retrospectively evaluated the expression of hENT1 and ERCC1 by immunostaining in chemo-naive primary bladder tumour specimens from 40 patients with metastatic bladder cancer who received treatment with gemcitabine-cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy at Wakayama Medical University Hospital and affiliated hospitals from May 2002 to July 2009. Immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was performed with specific hENT1 and ERCC1 antibodies scored by two pathologists who were blinded to clinical outcomes. The clinical and histopathological variables were analyzed to evaluate predictive values for survival. The median survival time in patients with high and low hENT1 expression was 17.3 and 11.6 months, respectively (log-rank test, P = 0.003). This contrasted with the median survival in patients with high and low ERCC1 expressions, which did not differ significantly (high ERCC1, 13.6 months; low ERCC1, 17.1 months; P = 0.178). In univariate Cox regression analyses for pretreatment clinicopathological variables, performance status (P = 0.02) and hENT1 expression (P = 0.004), but not ERCC1 expression (P = 0.182), were associated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model showed that hENT1 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.008). The data obtained in the present study show that high expression of hENT1 in tumour cells is associated with prolonged survival in patients with metastatic bladder cancer treated with gemcitabine-cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.

Dysregulation of PDGFRA has been reported in many cancers. However, PDGFRA mutations in melanomas have not been well studied. We analyzed the genetic mutations of PDGFRA in Chinese patients with melanoma and determined the inhibitory potency of TKIs, such as imatinib and crenolanib, on mutant PDGFRA. Of note, 351 melanoma tissue samples were examined for genetic mutations in exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA. Activities of mutations in response to imatinib and crenolanib were analyzed by Western blotting of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFRA and cell proliferation assays. PDGFRA mutations were observed in 4.6% (16 of 351) of melanomas, and these mutations were mainly detected in acral and mucosal melanomas. PDGFRA mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with KIT mutations, but may coexist with BRAF and NRAS mutations. The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA. Except that V658A mutation was imatinib-resistant, all the other mutations were sensitive to both imatinib and crenolanib. PDGFRA mutations are detected in a small population of melanoma patients. Our study suggests that patients with melanoma harboring certain PDGFRA mutations may benefit from imatinib and crenolanib treatment.	Dai J. et al.,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013

The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.	Schittenhelm MM. et al.,Cancer Res.,2006

Recommendations aimed to rationalize the use of BCR-ABL mutation testing in chronic myeloid leukemia have been compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Treatment and Outcome Study and are here reported. Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change. Some specific mutations weigh on TKI selection.	Soverini S. et al.,Blood,2011

Notably, ARID1A is mutated in over 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which currently have no effective therapy. To date, clinically applicable targeted cancer therapy based on ARID1A mutational status has not been described. Here we show that inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells and that ARID1A mutational status correlated with response to the EZH2 inhibitor. We identified PIK3IP1 as a direct target of ARID1A and EZH2 that is upregulated by EZH2 inhibition and contributed to the observed synthetic lethality by inhibiting PI3K-AKT signaling. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition caused regression of ARID1A-mutated ovarian tumors in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first data set to demonstrate a synthetic lethality between ARID1A mutation and EZH2 inhibition. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 represents a novel treatment strategy for cancers involving ARID1A mutations. ;;ARID1A, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is a recently identified tumor suppressor that is mutated in a broad spectrum of human cancers. Thus, it is of fundamental clinical importance to understand its molecular functions and determine whether ARID1A deficiency can be exploited therapeutically. In this article, we report a key function of ARID1A in regulating the DNA damage checkpoint. ARID1A is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via its interaction with the upstream DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATR. At the molecular level, ARID1A facilitates efficient processing of DSB to single-strand ends and sustains DNA damage signaling. Importantly, ARID1A deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors. ARID1A has been identified as one of the most frequently mutated genes across human cancers. Our data suggest that clinical utility of PARP inhibitors might be extended beyond patients with BRCA mutations to a larger group of patients with ARID1A-mutant tumors, which may exhibit therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibitors.;;	Bitler BG. et al.,Nat.

We investigated the role of cereblon (CRBN), a primary teratogenic target of thalidomide, in the antimyeloma activity of IMiDs. CRBN depletion is initially cytotoxic to human myeloma cells, but surviving cells with stable CRBN depletion become highly resistant to both lenalidomide and pomalidomide, but not to the unrelated drugs bortezomib, dexamethasone, and melphalan. Acquired deletion of CRBN was found to be the primary genetic event differentiating isogenic MM1.S cell lines cultured to be sensitive or resistant to lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Gene expression changes induced by lenalidomide were dramatically suppressed in the presence of CRBN depletion, further demonstrating that CRBN is required for lenalidomide activity. Downstream targets of CRBN include interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) previously reported to also be a target of lenalidomide. Patients exposed to, and putatively resistant to, lenalidomide had lower CRBN levels in paired samples before and after therapy.

Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations.	Iorio F. et al.,Cell,2016

Primary VS and Schwann cells, human malignant schwannoma HMS-97 cells and mouse Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells and schwannoma cells were prepared to investigate the growth inhibitory and anti-tumour activities of OSU-03012, a celecoxib-derived small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. Cell proliferation assays, apoptosis, Western blot, in vivo xenograft analysis using SCID mice and immunohistochemistry were performed. OSU-03012 inhibited cell proliferation more effectively in both VS and HMS-97 cells than in normal human Schwann cells. The IC5) of OSU-03012 at 48h was approximately 3.1 microM for VS cells and 2.6 microM for HMS-97 cells, compared with the IC(50) of greater than 12 microM for human Schwann cells. Similarly, mouse Nf2(-/-) schwannoma and Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition by OSU-03012 than wild-type mouse Schwann cells and mouse schwannoma cells established from transgenic mice carrying the NF2 promoter-driven SV40 T-antigen gene. Like VS cells, malignant schwannoma HMS-97 cells expressed high levels of activated AKT.

The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas, exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth. NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.,,;;Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous tumors.

These risks are further amplified in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a germ line predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple schwannomas, underlying the need for biological targeted therapies. Gleevec (STI571, imatinib mesylate), in addition to the bcr-abl oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia, inhibits c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, thereby expanding its use to several malignant and benign human diseases.

This design may be suited for use in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, postseptic knees, failed total knee arthroplasties with large bone stock deficiencies, and young, active, overweight individuals. Preservation of bone stock is possible because the fixation stems are nails rather than larger cement pegs, removal for revision is easier without cement, sequestration of microbes within cement cannot occur, and bone graft may be continually loaded with this type of prosthesis.

There is no medical treatment for such tumors. We determined the expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and three of its receptors, VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, and neuropilin-2, in paraffin-embedded samples from 21 vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and from 22 sporadic schwannomas. Ten consecutive patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas who were not candidates for standard treatment were treated with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. An imaging response was defined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor volume, as compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined as a significant increase in the word-recognition score, as compared with baseline. VEGF was expressed in 100% of vestibular schwannomas and VEGFR-2 in 32% of tumor vessels on immunohistochemical analysis. Before treatment, the median annual volumetric growth rate for 10 index tumors was 62%. After bevacizumab treatment in the 10 patients, tumors shrank in 9 patients, and 6 patients had an imaging response, which was maintained in 4 patients during 11 to 16 months of follow-up. The median best response to treatment was a volumetric reduction of 26%. Three patients were not eligible for a hearing response; of the remaining seven patients, four had a hearing response, two had stable hearing, and one had progressive hearing loss. There were 21 adverse events of grade 1 or 2. VEGF blockade with bevacizumab improved hearing in some, but not all, patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and was associated with a reduction in the volume of most growing vestibular schwannomas.,,Early studies suggest that bevacizumab treatment can result in tumor shrinkage and hearing improvement for some patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The aim of this study was to report extended follow-up in a larger cohort of similarly treated patients. Retrospective study. Tertiary referral center Thirty-one consecutive NF2 patients who received bevacizumab for progressive vestibular schwannomas. Hearing improvement, defined as an improvement in word recognition score above the 95% critical difference compared with baseline, and radiographic response, defined as a 20% or greater decrease in tumor volume compared with baseline. The median age was 26 years (range, 12-73 yr). The median volumetric tumor growth rate before treatment was 64% per year. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 14 months (range, 6-41 mo) with a total of 47 patient-years of follow-up. A hearing response occurred in 57% (13/23) of evaluable patients and a radiographic response in 55% (17/31) of target vestibular schwannomas. The median time to response was 3 months for both end points. The only clinical or radiographic feature at baseline that correlated with change in tumor volume at 3 months was the mean apparent diffusion coefficient value, a radiologic marker of edema (p = 0.036). Ninety percent of patients had stable or improved hearing after 1 year of treatment and 61% at 3 years; 88% of patients had stable or decreased tumor size after 1 year of treatment and 54% at 3 years. Overall, treatment was well tolerated. Bevacizumab treatment was followed by hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage in more than 50% of progressive vestibular schwannomas in NF2 patients. Stable or improved hearing was retained in the majority of patients.,,Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) can be responsible for brainstem compression and hearing loss. Surgical removal remains the standard therapy despite potential morbidity. Previous studies suggested that the inhibition of the VEGF-pathway with bevacizumab could result in hearing improvement, reduction of the tumor volume or both in adults. We retrospectively describe the French experience of bevacizumab treatment delivered for progressive VS in pediatric NF2 patients. Patients received Bevacizumab 5 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks according to the physician's choice. Follow-up included clinical assessment, audiometry and volumetric MRI every 3-6 months. Seven patients harboring 11 VS were included. The median age at inclusion was 15 years (11.4-18.8), and the median treatment duration was 11.3 months (3.2-55.6). At baseline, the median tumor volume was 1.2 cm(3) (0.52-13.5) and the median word recognition score was 90 % (0-100). We observed one major response, two minor responses and a decrease in the rate of tumor growth for the 4 other patients. The median annual growth rate before treatment was significantly higher than after 1 year of treatment (138 vs. 36 %, n = 5, p = 0.043). We noted one hearing improvement over the course of 1 year under treatment (hearing response rate was 14 %). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated. Our study supports that bevacizumab is an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric NF2 patients with growing VS. Thorough multidisciplinary evaluation is necessary to identify the best candidates prior to treatment. It is likely that a better functional outcome would be expected if targeted therapies were discussed early in the management of the disease. ;;In vitro treatment of Nf2-deficient cells with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors can reduce cellular proliferation. We sought to determine the activity of erlotinib for progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS) associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Retrospective case review. Tertiary referral center. Eleven NF2 patients with progressive VS who were poor candidates for standard therapy. Erlotinib 150 mg daily. A radiographic response was defined as >or= 20% decrease in tumor volume compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined as a statistically significant increase in word recognition score (WRS) compared with baseline; a minor hearing response was defined as a 10 dB improvement in pure-tone average with stable WRS. : Before treatment, the median and mean annual volumetric growth rate for 11 index VS were 26% and 46%, respectively. Among 10 evaluable patients, the median time-to-tumor progression was 9.2 months. Three patients with stable disease experienced maximum tumor shrinkage of 4%, 13%, and 14%. Nine patients underwent audiologic evaluations. One experienced a transient hearing response, 2 experienced minor hearing responses, 3 remained stable, and 2 developed progressive hearing loss. The median time-to-progressive hearing loss was 9.2 months and to either tumor growth or progressive hearing loss was 7.1 months. Adverse treatment effects included mild-to-moderate rash, diarrhea, and hair thinning, with 2 episodes of grade 3 toxicity. Erlotinib treatment was not associated with radiographic or hearing responses in NF2 patients with progressive VS. Because a subset of patients experienced prolonged stable disease, time-to-progression may be more appropriate than radiographic or hearing response for anti-EGFR agents in NF2-associated VS.;;In vitro treatment of Nf2-deficient cells with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors can reduce cellular proliferation.

Treatment options for NF2-associated tumors are limited, and to date, no medical therapies are FDA approved. The ideal chemotherapeutic agent would inhibit both VS and meningiomas simultaneously. The objectives of this study are (1) to test the efficacy of AR42, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, to inhibit VS and meningioma growth and (2) to investigate this drug's mechanisms of action. Primary cultures of human VS and meningioma cells were established. Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma and benign human meningioma Ben-Men-1 cells were also cultured. Cells were treated with AR42, and the drug's effects on proliferation and the cell cycle were analyzed using a methanethiosulfonate assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Human phospho-kinase arrays and Western blots were used to evaluate the effects of AR42 on intracellular signaling. The in vivo efficacy of AR42 was investigated using schwannoma xenografts. Tumor volumes were quantified using high-field, volumetric MRI, and molecular target analysis was performed using immunohistochemistry. AR42 inhibited the growth of primary human VS and Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma cells with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 500 nM and 250-350 nM, respectively. AR42 also inhibited primary meningioma cells and the benign meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1, with IC(50) values of 1.5 µM and 1.0 µM, respectively. AR42 treatment induced cell-cycle arrest at G(2) and apoptosis in both VS and meningioma cells. Also, AR42 exposure decreased phosphorylated Akt in schwannoma and meningioma cells. In vivo treatment with AR42 inhibited the growth of schwannoma xenografts, induced apoptosis, and decreased Akt activation. The potent growth inhibitory activity of AR42 in schwannoma and meningioma cells suggests that AR42 should be further evaluated as a potential treatment for NF2-associated tumors.;;Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disease that results in the formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) and multiple meningiomas.

The aim of this study was to report extended follow-up in a larger cohort of similarly treated patients. Retrospective study. Tertiary referral center Thirty-one consecutive NF2 patients who received bevacizumab for progressive vestibular schwannomas. Hearing improvement, defined as an improvement in word recognition score above the 95% critical difference compared with baseline, and radiographic response, defined as a 20% or greater decrease in tumor volume compared with baseline. The median age was 26 years (range, 12-73 yr). The median volumetric tumor growth rate before treatment was 64% per year. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 14 months (range, 6-41 mo) with a total of 47 patient-years of follow-up. A hearing response occurred in 57% (13/23) of evaluable patients and a radiographic response in 55% (17/31) of target vestibular schwannomas. The median time to response was 3 months for both end points. The only clinical or radiographic feature at baseline that correlated with change in tumor volume at 3 months was the mean apparent diffusion coefficient value, a radiologic marker of edema (p = 0.036). Ninety percent of patients had stable or improved hearing after 1 year of treatment and 61% at 3 years; 88% of patients had stable or decreased tumor size after 1 year of treatment and 54% at 3 years. Overall, treatment was well tolerated. Bevacizumab treatment was followed by hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage in more than 50% of progressive vestibular schwannomas in NF2 patients. Stable or improved hearing was retained in the majority of patients.,,Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) can be responsible for brainstem compression and hearing loss. Surgical removal remains the standard therapy despite potential morbidity. Previous studies suggested that the inhibition of the VEGF-pathway with bevacizumab could result in hearing improvement, reduction of the tumor volume or both in adults. We retrospectively describe the French experience of bevacizumab treatment delivered for progressive VS in pediatric NF2 patients. Patients received Bevacizumab 5 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks according to the physician's choice. Follow-up included clinical assessment, audiometry and volumetric MRI every 3-6 months.

There is no medical treatment for such tumors. We determined the expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and three of its receptors, VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, and neuropilin-2, in paraffin-embedded samples from 21 vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and from 22 sporadic schwannomas. Ten consecutive patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas who were not candidates for standard treatment were treated with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. An imaging response was defined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor volume, as compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined as a significant increase in the word-recognition score, as compared with baseline. VEGF was expressed in 100% of vestibular schwannomas and VEGFR-2 in 32% of tumor vessels on immunohistochemical analysis. Before treatment, the median annual volumetric growth rate for 10 index tumors was 62%. After bevacizumab treatment in the 10 patients, tumors shrank in 9 patients, and 6 patients had an imaging response, which was maintained in 4 patients during 11 to 16 months of follow-up. The median best response to treatment was a volumetric reduction of 26%. Three patients were not eligible for a hearing response; of the remaining seven patients, four had a hearing response, two had stable hearing, and one had progressive hearing loss. There were 21 adverse events of grade 1 or 2. VEGF blockade with bevacizumab improved hearing in some, but not all, patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and was associated with a reduction in the volume of most growing vestibular schwannomas.;;This single-institution phase II study was performed to estimate the response rate to lapatinib in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients with progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS). Twenty-one eligible patients were enrolled. Brain and spine MRIs, including 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis, and audiograms were performed once at baseline and again every 12 weeks. The primary response end point was evaluable in 17 patients and defined as ≥15% decrease in VS volume. Hearing was evaluable as a secondary end point in 13 patients, with responses defined as an improvement in the pure tone average of at least 10 dB  or a statistically significant increase in word recognition scores. Four of 17 evaluable patients experienced an objective volumetric response (23.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-47%), with median time to response of 4.5 months (range, 3-12). In responders, reduction in VS volumes ranged from -15.7% to -23.9%. Four of 13 patients evaluable for hearing met hearing criteria for response (30.8%; 95% CI, 13%-58%). One sustained response exceeded 9 months in duration. Median time to overall progression (ie, volumetric progression or hearing loss) was 14 months. The estimated overall progression-free survival and volumetric progression-free survival at 12 months were 64.2% (95% CI, 36.9%-82.1%) and 70.6% (95% CI, 43.1%-86.6%), respectively. Toxicity was generally minor, and no permanent dose modifications were required. Lapatinib carries minor toxicity and has objective activity in NF2 patients with progressive VS, including volumetric and hearing responses. Future studies could explore combination therapy with other molecular targeted agents such as bevacizumab.,,;;This single-institution phase II study was performed to estimate the response rate to lapatinib in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients with progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS).

The chaperone protein HSP90 is essential for the stabilization of these signaling molecules. The aim of the study was to characterize the effect of HSP90 inhibition in various NF2-deficient models. We tested efficacy of the small-molecule NXD30001, which has been shown to be a potent HSP90 inhibitor. The antiproliferative activity of NXD30001 was tested in NF2-deficient cell lines and in human primary schwannoma and meningioma cultures in vitro. The antitumor efficacy of HSP90 inhibition in vivo was verified in two allograft models and in one NF2 transgenic model. The underlying molecular alteration was further characterized by a global transcriptome approach. NXD30001 induced degradation of client proteins in and suppressed proliferation of NF2-deficient cells. Differential expression analysis identified subsets of genes implicated in cell proliferation, cell survival, vascularization, and Schwann cell differentiation whose expression was altered by NXD30001 treatment. The results showed that NXD30001 in NF2-deficient schwannoma suppressed multiple pathways necessary for tumorigenesis. HSP90 inhibition showing significant antitumor activity against NF2-related tumor cells in vitro and in vivo represents a promising option for novel NF2 therapies.;;The growth and survival of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-deficient cells are enhanced by the activation of multiple signaling pathways including ErbBs/IGF-1R/Met, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk1/2.

Recent studies have established a requirement for the PAKs in the pathogenesis of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited cancer disorder caused by mutations at the NF2 gene locus. Merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene, has been shown to negatively regulate signaling through the PAKs and the tumor suppressive functions of Merlin are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the PAKs. Knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 expression, through RNAi-based approaches, impairs the proliferation of NF2-null schwannoma cells in culture and inhibits their ability to form tumors in vivo. These data implicate the PAKs as potential therapeutic targets. High-throughput screening of a library of small molecules combined with a structure-activity relationship approach resulted in the identification of FRAX597, a small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent inhibitor of the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the FRAX597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that traverses the gatekeeper residue and positions the thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site, a site rarely targeted by kinase inhibitors. FRAX597 inhibits the proliferation of NF2-deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent anti-tumor activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma development in an orthotopic model of NF2. These studies identify a novel class of orally available ATP-competitive Group I PAK inhibitors with significant potential for the treatment of NF2 and other cancers. ,,Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors in the central nervous system, most notably schwannomas and meningiomas. Mutational inactivation of NF2 is found in 40-60% of sporadic meningiomas, but the molecular mechanisms underlying malignant changes of meningioma cells remain unclear. Because group I p21-activated kinases (Paks) bind to and are inhibited by the NF2-encoded protein Merlin, we assessed the signaling and anti-tumor effects of three group-I specific Pak inhibitors - Frax597, 716 and 1036 - in NF2-/- meningiomas in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model. We found that these Pak inhibitors suppressed the proliferation and motility of both benign (Ben-Men1) and malignant (KT21-MG1) meningiomas cells. In addition, we found a strong reduction in phosphorylation of Mek and S6, and decreased cyclin D1 expression in both cell lines after treatment with Pak inhibitors. Using intracranial xenografts of luciferase-expressing KT21-MG1 cells, we found that treated mice showed significant tumor suppression for all three Pak inhibitors. Similar effects were observed in Ben-Men1 cells. Tumors dissected from treated animals exhibited an increase in apoptosis without notable change in proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that Pak inhibitors might be useful agents in treating NF2-deficient meningiomas. ;;The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are immediate downstream effectors of the Rac/Cdc42 small G-proteins and implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in various types of cancer including breast and lung carcinomas.

Everolimus is an oral inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) with antitumor activity in a variety of cancers. We conducted a single-institution, prospective, 2-stage, open-label phase II study to estimate the response rate to everolimus in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients with progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS). Ten eligible patients were enrolled, including 2 pediatric patients. Everolimus was administered at a daily dose of 10 mg (adults) or 5 mg/m(2)/day (children <18 y) orally in continuous 28-day courses, for up to 12 courses. Response was assessed every 3 months with MRI, using 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis, and audiograms. Nine patients were evaluable for the primary response, defined as ≥15% decrease in VS volume. Hearing response was evaluable as a secondary endpoint in 8 patients. None of the 9 patients with evaluable disease experienced a clinical or MRI response. No objective imaging or hearing responses were observed in stage 1 of the trial, and the study was closed according to predefined stopping rules. Everolimus is ineffective for the treatment of progressive VS in NF2 patients. We are currently conducting a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (\"phase 0\") study of everolimus in presurgical VS patients to elucidate the biological basis for apparent treatment resistance to mTORC1 inhibition in these tumors.,,;;Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is thought to be a key driver of tumor growth in Merlin (NF2)-deficient tumors.

In a diverse panel of cancer cell lines, we found that the cells most sensitive to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition lack expression of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, Merlin. Merlin expression is often lost in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-induced aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. Our data demonstrate that low Merlin expression predicts for increased sensitivity of MPM cells to a FAK inhibitor, VS-4718, in vitro and in tumor xenograft models. Disruption of MPM cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts with blocking antibodies suggests that weak cell-cell adhesions in Merlin-negative MPM cells underlie their greater dependence on cell-ECM-induced FAK signaling. This provides one explanation of why Merlin-negative cells are vulnerable to FAK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, we validated aldehyde dehydrogenase as a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MPM, a cell population thought to mediate tumor relapse after chemotherapy. Whereas pemetrexed and cisplatin, standard-of-care agents for MPM, enrich for CSCs, FAK inhibitor treatment preferentially eliminates these cells. These preclinical results provide the rationale for a clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design, the FAK inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through reduction of CSCs along with a strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially benefit from FAK inhibitor treatment. ,,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in serous ovarian cancer. Loss of merlin, a product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, is being evaluated as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in mesothelioma. Connections between merlin and FAK in ovarian cancer remain undefined. Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, also termed VS-6062) from 0.1 to 1 μM for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. Greater than 50% inhibition of OVCAR8, HEY, and ID8-IP ovarian carcinoma cell growth occurred with 0.1 μM PF-271 in anchorage-independent (p<0.001) but not in adherent culture conditions. PF-271-mediated reduction in FAK Y397 phosphorylation occurred independently of growth inhibition. Suspended growth of OVCAR3, OVCAR10, IGROV1, IGROV1-IP, SKOV3, SKOV3-IP, A2780, and 5009-MOVCAR was not affected by 0.1 μM PF-271. Merlin expression did not correlate with serous ovarian tumor grade or stage. PF-271 (30 mg/kg, BID) did not inhibit 5009-MOVCAR tumor growth and merlin knockdown in SKOV3-IP and OVCAR10 cells did not alter suspended cell growth upon PF-271 addition. Differential responsiveness to FAK inhibitor treatment was observed. Intrinsic low merlin protein level correlated with PF-271-mediated anchorage-independent growth inhibition, but reduction in merlin expression did not induce sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Merlin levels may be useful for patient stratification in FAK inhibitor trials.;;The goal of targeted therapy is to match a selective drug with a genetic lesion that predicts for drug sensitivity.

These preclinical results provide the rationale for a clinical trial in MPM patients using a FAK inhibitor as a single agent after first-line chemotherapy. With this design, the FAK inhibitor could potentially induce a more durable clinical response through reduction of CSCs along with a strong antitumor effect. Furthermore, our data suggest that patients with Merlin-negative tumors may especially benefit from FAK inhibitor treatment. ,,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in serous ovarian cancer. Loss of merlin, a product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, is being evaluated as a biomarker for FAK inhibitor sensitivity in mesothelioma. Connections between merlin and FAK in ovarian cancer remain undefined. Nine human and two murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed for growth in the presence of a small molecule FAK inhibitor (PF-271, also termed VS-6062) from 0.1 to 1 μM for 72 h. Merlin was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunostaining of a human ovarian tumor tissue array. Growth of cells was analyzed in an orthotopic tumor model and evaluated in vitro after stable shRNA-mediated merlin knockdown. Greater than 50% inhibition of OVCAR8, HEY, and ID8-IP ovarian carcinoma cell growth occurred with 0.1 μM PF-271 in anchorage-independent (p<0.001) but not in adherent culture conditions. PF-271-mediated reduction in FAK Y397 phosphorylation occurred independently of growth inhibition. Suspended growth of OVCAR3, OVCAR10, IGROV1, IGROV1-IP, SKOV3, SKOV3-IP, A2780, and 5009-MOVCAR was not affected by 0.1 μM PF-271. Merlin expression did not correlate with serous ovarian tumor grade or stage. PF-271 (30 mg/kg, BID) did not inhibit 5009-MOVCAR tumor growth and merlin knockdown in SKOV3-IP and OVCAR10 cells did not alter suspended cell growth upon PF-271 addition. Differential responsiveness to FAK inhibitor treatment was observed. Intrinsic low merlin protein level correlated with PF-271-mediated anchorage-independent growth inhibition, but reduction in merlin expression did not induce sensitivity to FAK inhibition. Merlin levels may be useful for patient stratification in FAK inhibitor trials.;;Mesenchymal/metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) are often triple-negative (TNBC), and chemo-refractory, and can harbor phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3kinase) alterations; thus, therapy with mTor inhibitors may demonstrate activity. Patients with mesenchymal/MpBC treated with temsirolimus-based regimens were evaluated. Mutational analyses [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA sequencing method, mass spectrometric detection (Sequenom MassARRAY), or next-generation sequencing] as well as loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (immunohistochemistry) were performed (archived tissue when available). Twenty-three patients (one of whom was on two separate trials) were treated using temsirolimus-containing regimens: temsirolimus alone (n = 1 patient) or combined with the following: liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab (DAT, n = 18); liposomal doxorubicin (DT, n = 1); paclitaxel and bevacizumab (TAT, n = 2); paclitaxel (TT, n = 1); carboplatin and bevacizumab (CAT, n = 1). Response rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] was 25% across all regimens; 32% in the anthracycline-based regimens [DAT and DT (CR = 2, PR = 4; N = 19)]. An additional two patients achieved stable disease (SD) ≥6 months [total SD ≥6 months/CR/PR = 8 (33%)]. Molecular aberrations in the PI3K pathway were common: PIK3CA mutation = 6/15 (40%), PTEN mutation = 3/11 (27%), and PTEN loss = 2/11 (18%). A point mutation in the NF2 gene (K159fs*16; NF2 alterations can activate mTor) was found in one patient who attained CR (3+ years). Of the eight patients who achieved SD ≥6 months/CR/PR, all 4 patients with available tissue had a molecular aberration that activate the PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR axis: PIK3CA mutation = 2; PTEN loss = 1; NF2 aberration = 1.

Merlin expression, encoded by the NF2 gene, is lost in a majority of meningiomas, and merlin is a negative regulator of mTORC1. The sst2 somatostatin receptor, targeted by octreotide, is highly expressed in meningiomas. To investigate new therapeutic strategies, we evaluated the activity of everolimus (mTOR inhibitor), BKM-120 and BEZ-235 (new Pi3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors), octreotide and a combined treatment (octreotide plus everolimus), on cell proliferation, signaling pathways, and cell cycle proteins, respectively. The in vitro study was conducted on human meningioma primary cells extracted from fresh tumors, allowing the assessment of somatostatin analogs at the concentration levels used in patients. The results were correlated to WHO grades. Further, everolimus decreased cell viability of human meningiomas, but concomitantly, induced Akt activation, reducing the antiproliferative effect of the drug. The new Pi3K inhibitors were not more active than everolimus alone, limiting their clinical relevance. In contrast, a clear cooperative inhibitory effect of octreotide and everolimus was observed on cell proliferation in all tested meningiomas, including WHO grades II-III. Octreotide not only reversed everolimus-induced Akt phosphorylation but also displayed additive and complementary effects with everolimus on downstream proteins involved in translation (4EB-P1), and controlling cell cycle (p27Kip1 and cyclin D1). We have demonstrated a co-operative action between everolimus and octreotide on cell proliferation in human meningiomas, including aggressive ones, establishing the basis for a clinical trial. ;;Treatment for recurrent and aggressive meningiomas remains an unmet medical need in neuro-oncology, and chemotherapy exhibits limited clinical activity, if any.

The 22q tumor suppressor NF2, encoding merlin, is implicated in this interaction because of its frequent loss of function in human thyroid cancer cell lines. Nf2 deletion or Hras mutation is insufficient for transformation, whereas their combined disruption leads to murine PDTC with increased MAPK signaling. Merlin loss induces RAS signaling in part through inactivation of Hippo, which activates a YAP-TEAD transcriptional program. We find that the three RAS genes are themselves YAP-TEAD1 transcriptional targets, providing a novel mechanism of promotion of RAS-induced tumorigenesis. Moreover, pharmacologic disruption of YAP-TEAD with verteporfin blocks RAS transcription and signaling and inhibits cell growth. The increased MAPK output generated by NF2 loss in RAS-mutant cancers may inform therapeutic strategies, as it generates greater dependency on the MAPK pathway for viability. Intensification of mutant RAS signaling through copy-number imbalances is commonly associated with transformation. We show that NF2/merlin inactivation augments mutant RAS signaling by promoting YAP/TEAD-driven transcription of oncogenic and wild-type RAS, resulting in greater MAPK output and increased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.;;Ch22q LOH is preferentially associated with RAS mutations in papillary and in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC).

In a phase 1 clinical trial, we assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0449, a small-molecule inhibitor of SMO, and responses of metastatic or locally advanced basal-cell carcinoma to the drug. We selected 33 patients with metastatic or locally advanced basal-cell carcinoma to receive oral GDC-0449 at one of three doses; 17 patients received 150 mg per day, 15 patients received 270 mg per day, and 1 patient received 540 mg per day. We assessed tumor responses with the use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), physical examination, or both. Molecular aspects of the tumors were examined. The median duration of the study treatment was 9.8 months. Of the 33 patients, 18 had an objective response to GDC-0449, according to assessment on imaging (7 patients), physical examination (10 patients), or both (1 patient). Of the patients who had a response, 2 had a complete response and 16 had a partial response. The other 15 patients had either stable disease (11 patients) or progressive disease (4 patients). Eight grade 3 adverse events that were deemed to be possibly related to the study drug were reported in six patients, including four with fatigue, two with hyponatremia, one with muscle spasm, and one with atrial fibrillation. One grade 4 event, asymptomatic hyponatremia, was judged to be unrelated to GDC-0449. One patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events. We found evidence of hedgehog signaling in tumors that responded to the treatment. GDC-0449, an orally active small molecule that targets the hedgehog pathway, appears to have antitumor activity in locally advanced or metastatic basal-cell carcinoma. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00607724.),,Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Aberrant activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway is strongly implicated in the development of some cases of medulloblastoma. A 26-year-old man with metastatic medulloblastoma that was refractory to multiple therapies was treated with a novel hedgehog pathway inhibitor, GDC-0449; treatment resulted in rapid (although transient) regression of the tumor and reduction of symptoms. Molecular analyses of tumor specimens obtained before treatment suggested that there was activation of the hedgehog pathway, with loss of heterozygosity and somatic mutation of the gene encoding patched homologue 1 (PTCH1), a key negative regulator of hedgehog signaling.;;;;Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, with metastases present at diagnosis conferring a poor prognosis. Mechanisms of dissemination are poorly understood and metastatic lesions are genetically divergent from the matched primary tumor. Effective and less toxic therapies that target both compartments have yet to be identified. Here, we report that the analysis of several large nonoverlapping cohorts of patients with medulloblastoma reveals MET kinase as a marker of sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven medulloblastoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated, active MET kinase in an independent patient cohort confirmed its correlation with increased tumor relapse and poor survival, suggesting that patients with SHH medulloblastoma may benefit from MET-targeted therapy. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the approved MET inhibitor foretinib could suppress MET activation, decrease tumor cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in SHH medulloblastomas in vitro and in vivo. Foretinib penetrated the blood-brain barrier and was effective in both the primary and metastatic tumor compartments. In established mouse xenograft or transgenic models of metastatic SHH medulloblastoma, foretinib administration reduced the growth of the primary tumor, decreased the incidence of metastases, and increased host survival. Taken together, our results provide a strong rationale to clinically evaluate foretinib as an effective therapy for patients with SHH-driven medulloblastoma.	Von Hoff DD. et al.,N. Engl. J.

PJS patients develop gastrointestinal hamartomas with 100% penetrance often in the second decade of life, and demonstrate an increased predisposition toward the development of a number of additional malignancies. Among mitogenic signaling pathways, the mammalian-target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is hyperactivated in tissues and tumors derived from LKB1-deficient mice. Consistent with a central role for mTORC1 in these tumors, rapamycin as a single agent results in a dramatic suppression of preexisting GI polyps in LKB1+/- mice. However, the key targets of mTORC1 in LKB1-deficient tumors remain unknown. We demonstrate here that these polyps, and LKB1- and AMPK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, show dramatic up-regulation of the HIF-1alpha transcription factor and its downstream transcriptional targets in an rapamycin-suppressible manner. The HIF-1alpha targets hexokinase II and Glut1 are up-regulated in these polyps, and using FDG-PET, we demonstrate that LKB1+/- mice show increased glucose utilization in focal regions of their GI tract corresponding to these gastrointestinal hamartomas. Importantly, we demonstrate that polyps from human Peutz-Jeghers patients similarly exhibit up-regulated mTORC1 signaling, HIF-1alpha, and GLUT1 levels. Furthermore, like HIF-1alpha and its target genes, the FDG-PET signal in the GI tract of these mice is abolished by rapamycin treatment.

We analyzed these primary and metastatic de novo lung cancers with integrated genomic and proteomic profiles, and have identified gene and phosphoprotein signatures associated with Lkb1 loss and progression to invasive and metastatic lung tumors. These studies revealed that SRC is activated in Lkb1-deficient primary and metastatic lung tumors, and that the combined inhibition of SRC, PI3K, and MEK1/2 resulted in synergistic tumor regression.

Inhibitors targeting the activity of BET proteins have shown potent antiproliferative effects in hematological cancers through the suppression of c-MYC and downstream target genes. However, as the epigenetic landscape of a cell varies drastically depending on lineage, transcriptional coactivators such as BETs would be expected to have different targets in cancers derived from different cells of origin, and this may influence the activity and mechanism of action of BET inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we treated a panel of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) cell lines with the BET inhibitor JQ1 and found that a subset is acutely susceptible to BET inhibition. In contrast to blood tumors, we show that LAC cells are inhibited by JQ1 through a mechanism independent of c-MYC down-regulation. Through gene expression profiling, we discovered that the oncogenic transcription factor FOSL1 and its targets are suppressed by JQ1 in a dose-dependant manner. Knockdown of BRD4 also decreased FOSL1 levels, and inhibition of FOSL1 phenocopied the effects of JQ1 treatment, suggesting that loss of this transcription factor may be partly responsible for the cytotoxic effects of BET inhibition in LAC cells, although ectopic expression of FOSL1 alone did not rescue the phenotype. Together, these findings suggest that BET inhibitors may be useful in solid tumors and that cell-lineage-specific differences in transcriptional targets of BETs may influence the activity of inhibitors of these proteins in different cancer types.,,Amplification of MYC is one of the most common genetic alterations in lung cancer, contributing to a myriad of phenotypes associated with growth, invasion, and drug resistance. Murine genetics has established both the centrality of somatic alterations of Kras in lung cancer, as well as the dependency of mutant Kras tumors on MYC function. Unfortunately, drug-like small-molecule inhibitors of KRAS and MYC have yet to be realized. The recent discovery, in hematologic malignancies, that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibition impairs MYC expression and MYC transcriptional function established the rationale of targeting KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BET inhibition. We performed functional assays to evaluate the effects of JQ1 in genetically defined NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and/or LKB1 mutations. Furthermore, we evaluated JQ1 in transgenic mouse lung cancer models expressing mutant kras or concurrent mutant kras and lkb1. Effects of bromodomain inhibition on transcriptional pathways were explored and validated by expression analysis. Although JQ1 is broadly active in NSCLC cells, activity of JQ1 in mutant KRAS NSCLC is abrogated by concurrent alteration or genetic knockdown of LKB1. In sensitive NSCLC models, JQ1 treatment results in the coordinate downregulation of the MYC-dependent transcriptional program. We found that JQ1 treatment produces significant tumor regression in mutant kras mice. As predicted, tumors from mutant kras and lkb1 mice did not respond to JQ1. Bromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant NSCLC with wild-type LKB1, via inhibition of MYC function. Clinical studies of BET bromodomain inhibitors in aggressive NSCLC will be actively pursued. Clin Cancer Res; 19(22); 6183-92. ©2013 AACR.

We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas.	Prickett TD. et al.,Nat. Genet.,2009

SLC44A4 is a member of a family of putative choline transporters that we show to be markedly upregulated in a variety of epithelial tumors, most notably prostate and pancreatic cancer. SLC44A4 is normally expressed on the apical surface of secretory epithelial cells, but in cancer we show expression is not restricted to the luminal surface in advanced and undifferentiated tumors. ASG-5ME consists of a human IgG2 anti-SLC44A4 antibody conjugated through a cleavable linker to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethylauristatin E. It has potent antitumor activity in both cell line - and patient-derived xenograft models of pancreatic and prostate cancers. Combination studies with ASG-5ME and nab-paclitaxel demonstrated combination effect in both pancreatic and prostate tumor models. Altogether, the data presented here suggest that ASG-5ME may have the potential to offer a new therapeutic option for the treatment of pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib. Dacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.;;Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib. Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.	;;;;;;;;;;;;Ramalingam SS. et al.,J.
